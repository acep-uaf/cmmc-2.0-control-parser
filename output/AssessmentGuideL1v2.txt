Introduction 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13 
1 
 
Introduction 
This  document  provides  guidance in  the  preparation  for  and  execution  of  a Level  1 self-
assessment under the  Cybersecurity  Maturity  Model  Certification  (CMMC)  Program as  set  
forth  in  section  170.15 of  title  32,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR). Guidance  for  
conducting  a  Level  2 self-assessment  or  certification assessment  can  be  found  in  CMMC 
Assessment  Guide – Level 2. Guidance for conducting a Level 3 certification assessment can 
be found in CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3. More details on the CMMC Model can be found 
in CMMC Model Overview. 
Level 1 focuses on the protection of Federal Contract Information (FCI),   which is defined in 
32 CFR § 170.4 and 48 CFR § 4.1901: 
Federal   contract   information   means   information,   not   intended   for   public   
release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under a contract to 
develop  or  deliver  a  product  or  service  to  the  Government,  but  not  including  
information  provided  by  the  Government  to  the  public  (such  as  on  public  
websites)  or  simple  transactional  information,  such  as  necessary  to  process  
payments. 
Level  1  is  comprised  of  the 15 basic  safeguarding  requirements  specified  in  Federal  
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.204-21. 
Purpose and Audience  
This   guide   is   intended   for   Organizations   Seeking   Assessment   (OSAs),   cybersecurity   
professionals, and individuals and companies that support CMMC efforts. This document can 
be used as part of preparation for and conducting a Level 1 self-assessment. 
Document Organization 
This document is organized into the following sections: 
• Assessment  and  Compliance: provides  an  overview  of  the  Level  1  self-assessment 
process  set  forth  in 32 CFR  § 170.15, describes  ways  of  documenting  compliance,  and 
provides guidance regarding OSA  size  and the self-assessment  scope  requirements  set  
forth in 32 CFR § 170.19. 
• CMMC-Custom Terms: incorporates  definitions  from  32  CFR  § 170.4 and  definitions  
included by reference from 32 CFR § 170.2, and provides clarification of the intent and 
scope of custom terms as used in the context of CMMC. 
• Assessment    Criteria    and Methodology:    provides    guidance    on    criteria    and    
methodology  (i.e.,  interview, examine,  and  test)  that  may  be  employed during  a  Level  1  
self-assessment, as well as on assessment findings. 
• Requirement   Descriptions: provides guidance specific to each   Level   1 security 
requirement. 

 
Assessment and Compliance 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13 
2 
 
Assessment and Compliance 
Level 1 self-assessment requirements are set forth in 32 CFR § 170.15. The OSA will assess 
its own contractor information system(s) to determine if it meet all the basic safeguarding 
requirements for FCI specified in FAR Clause 52.204-21. OSAs should use the self-assessment 
methods as described in 32 CFR § 170.15. 
Level  1 requirements  may  apply  to an  entire  enterprise  infrastructure or to  a  particular 
enclave(s), depending upon where the FCI will be processed, stored, or transmitted. 
OSAs can choose to perform the annual self-assessment internally or engage a third party to 
assist. Use of a third party to assist is still considered a self-assessment and does not result 
in  a  certification. The  primary  result  of  a  self-assessment  is  the  submission  of  Level  1 
compliance results into the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) and a self-assessment 
report, which contains the findings associated with the self- assessment. 
Assessment Scope 
Prior to conducting a  Level 1 self-assessment, the OSA must specify the CMMC Assessment 
Scope as defined in 32 CFR § 170.19(a). The CMMC Assessment Scope identifies which assets 
within  the  OSA’s environment  will  be  assessed  and  the  details  of  the  self-assessment. In 
accordance  with  §170.19,  for  a  Level  1  self-a ssessment,  the  assets  that  process,  store,  or  
transmit   FCI   are   considered   in-scope   and   should be   assessed   against   the Level   1 
requirements. See the CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 1 document for additional information. 

 
CMMC-Custom Terms 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13

CMMC-Custom Te r m s 
The CMMC Program has custom terms that align with program requirements. Although some 
terms may have other definitions in open forums, it is important to understand these terms 
as they apply to the CMMC Program.  
The custom terms associated with Level 1 are: 
• Assessment:  As  defined  in  32  CFR  §  170.4 means the  testing  or  evaluation  of  security  
controls  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the  controls  are  implemented  correctly,  
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the 
security requirements for an information system or organization, as defined in 32 CFR § 
170.15 to 32 CFR § 170.18. 
o Level  1  self-assessment  is  the  term  for  the  activity  performed  by  an  OSA  to  
evaluate its own information system, when seeking a CMMC Status of Final Level 
1 (Self). 
• Assessment Objective: A set of determination statements that, taken together, 
expresses the desired outcome for the assessment of a security requirement. Successful 
implementation of the corresponding CMMC security requirement requires meeting all 
applicable assessment objectives defined in NIST SP 800–171A or NIST SP 800-172A. 
• Asset:  An  item  of  value  to  stakeholders.  An  asset  may  be  tangible  (e.g.,  a  physical  item  
such  as  hardware,  firmware,  computing  platform,  network  device,  or  other  technology  
component) or intangible (e.g., humans, data, information, software, capability, function, 
service,  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  intellectual  property,  image,  or  reputation).  The  
value of an asset is determined by stakeholders in consideration of loss concerns across 
the  entire  system  life  cycle.  Such  concerns  include  but  are  not  limited  to  business  or  
mission concerns, as defined in NIST SP 800-160 Rev 1. 
• CMMC  Status:  As  defined  in  32  CFR §  170.4 is  the  result  of  meeting  or  exceeding  the  
minimum required score for the corresponding assessment. The CMMC Status of an OSA 
information system is officially stored in SPRS and additionally presented on a Certificate 
of CMMC Status, if the assessment was conducted by a C3PAO or DCMA DIBCAC. 
o Final Level 1 (Self) is defined in § 170.15(c)(1). To achieve a CMMC Status of Final 
Level   1   (Self)   the   OSA   must conduct   a   Level   1   self-assessment   scored   in   
accordance with the CMMC Scoring Methodology described in § 170.24. The Level 
1  self-assessment  must  be  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Level  1  scope  
requirements  set  forth  in  §  170.19(a)  and  (b).  In  instances  where  an  objective  
addresses CUI, the term FCI should be substituted for CUI. 
• Component: A  discrete  identifiable  information  technology  asset  that  represents  a  
building  block  of  a  system  and  may  include  hardware,  software,  and  firmware
1
.  A 
component is one type of asset.

• Enduring Exception: A special circumstance or system where remediation and full 
compliance with CMMC security requirements is not feasible. Examples include systems 
required to replicate the configuration of ‘fielded’ systems, medical devices, test 
equipment, OT, and IoT. No operational plan of action is required but the circumstance 
must be documented within a system security plan. Specialized Assets and GFE may be 
Enduring Exceptions. 
• Information  System (IS): A  discrete  set  of  information  resources  organized  for  the  
collection,   processing,   maintenance,   use,   sharing,   dissemination,   or   disposition   of   
information [NIST 800-171 Rev. 2]. An IS is one type of asset. 
• Monitoring: Continual  checking,  supervising,  critically  observing,  or  determining  the  
status in order to identify change from the performance level required or expected [NIST 
SP 800-160 Vol 1]. 
• Operational  plan  of  action: As  used  in  security  requirement  CA.L2-3.12.2,  means  the  
formal artifact which identifies temporary vulnerabilities and temporary deficiencies in 
implementation of requirements and documents how and when they will be mitigated, 
corrected,  or  eliminated.  The  OSA  defines  the  format  (e.g.,  document,  spreadsheet, 
database)  and  specific  content  of  its  operational  plan  of  action. An  operational  plan  of  
action is not the same as a POA&M associated with an assessment. 
• Organization-Defined: As determined by the OSA being assessed except as defined in 
the case of Organization-Defined Parameter (ODP). This can be applied to a frequency or 
rate at which something occurs within a given time period, or it could be associated with 
describing the configuration of an OSA’s solution. 
• Temporary deficiency: As defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 means a condition where 
remediation of a discovered deficiency is feasible and a known fix is available or is in 
process. The deficiency must be documented in an operational plan of action. A 
temporary deficiency is not based on an ‘in progress’ initial implementation of a CMMC 
security requirement but arises after implementation. A temporary deficiency may 
apply during the initial implementation of a security requirement if, during roll-out, 
specific issues with a very limited subset of equipment is discovered that must be 
separately addressed. There is no standard duration for which a temporary deficiency 
may be active.  For example, FIPS-validated cryptography that requires a patch and the 
patched version is no longer the validated version may be a temporary deficiency.

Assessment Criteria and Methodology 
This CMMC Assessment   Guide   – Level   1   provides   guidance   regarding   the   assessment 
procedures   required by 32 CFR § 170.15, which requires the Level 1 self-a  ssessment to be 
performed using the objectives defined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171A
2
. NIST SP 
800-171A Section 2.1 says the following: 
An  assessment  procedure  consists  of  an  assessment  objective  and  a  set  of  
potential  assessment  methods  and  assessment  objects  that  can  be  used  to  
conduct  the  assessment.  Each  assessment  objective  includes  a  determination  
statement related to the requirement that is the subject of the assessment. The 
determination statements are linked to the content of the requirement to ensure 
traceability of the assessment results to the requirements. The application of an 
assessment  procedure  to  a  requirement  produces  assessment  findings.  These  
findings reflect, or are subsequently used, to help determine if the requirement 
has been satisfied. 
Assessment  objects  identify  the  specific  items  being  assessed  and  can  include  
specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals. 
• Specifications    are    the    document-based    artifacts    (e.g.,    policies,    
procedures,      security      plans,      security      requirements,      functional      
specifications, and architectural designs) associated with a system. 
• Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards 
employed within a system. 
• Activities  are  the  protection-related  actions  supporting  a  system  that  
involve  people  (e.g.,  conducting  system  backup  operations,  exercising  a  
contingency plan, and monitoring network traffic). 
• Individuals,    or    groups    of    individuals,    are    people    applying    the    
specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above. 
The  assessment  methods  define  the  nature  and  the  extent  of  the  assessor’s 
actions. The methods include examine, interview, and test. 
• The examine method  is  the  process  of  reviewing,  inspecting,  observing,  
studying,     or     analyzing     assessment     objects     (i.e.,     specifications,     
mechanisms,   activities).   The   purpose   of   the   examine method   is   to   
facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. 
• The interview   method   is   the   process   of   holding   discussions   with   
individuals or groups of individuals to facilitate understanding, achieve 
clarification, or obtain evidence.

• And finally, the test method is the process of exercising assessment objects 
(i.   e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual 
with expected behavior. 
In  all  three  assessment  methods,  the  results  are  used  in  making  specific  
determinations  called  for  in  the  determination  statements  and  thereby  
achieving the objectives for the assessment procedure. 
The guidance specified in NIST SP 800-171A focuses on Controlled Unclassified Information 
(CUI). Since Level 1  focuses  on  safeguarding FCI, the applicable self-assessment objectives 
for Level   1 are modified   to   address   FCI   rather   than CUI   as   set   forth   in   32 CFR   § 
170.15(c)(1)(i). Where CUI is noted in a NIST SP 800-171A assessment objective, [FCI] has 
been substituted   in   the   Level   1 objective   description.   Level   1   security   requirement   
descriptions align with FAR Clause 52.204-21. 
Criteria 
Assessment objectives are provided for each Level 1 requirement and are based on existing 
criteria  in NIST  SP  800-171A  modified  for  FCI  rather  than CUI  as  set  forth  in  32 CFR  § 
170.15(c)(1)(i). The criteria are authoritative and provide the basis for the self-assessment 
of a requirement. 
Methodology 
To verify and validate that an OSA is meeting CMMC requirements, evidence needs to exist 
demonstrating that the OSA has fulfilled the objectives of the Level 1 requirements. Because 
different self-assessment    objectives    can    be    met    in    different    ways    (e.g.,    through    
documentation,  computer  configuration,  network  configuration,  or  training),   a  variety  of  
techniques may be used to determine if the OSA meets the Level 1 requirements, including 
any of the three assessment methods from NIST SP 800-171A. 
Follow the guidance in NIST SP 800-171A when determining which assessment methods to 
use: 
Organizations  [OSAs] are  not  expected  to  employ  all  assessment  methods  and  
objects    contained    within    the    assessment    procedures    identified    in    this    
publication.  Rather,  organizations  have  the  flexibility  to  determine  the  level  of  
effort   needed   and   the   assurance   required   for   an   assessment   (e.g.,   which   
assessment methods and assessment objects are deemed to be the most useful in 
obtaining  the  desired  results).  This  determination  is  made  based  on  how  the  
organization can accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective 
manner  and  with  sufficient  confidence  to  support  the  determination  that  the  
[FCI] requirements have been satisfied. 
For more detailed information on assessment methods, see NIST SP 800-171A Appendix D.

Who Is Interviewed 
Interviews  of  applicable  staff  (possibly  at  different  organizational  levels)  may  provide  
information  to  help  an  entity  determine  if  Level  1 security  requirements  have  been 
implemented,  as  well  as  if  adequate  resourcing,  training,  and  planning  have  occurred  for  
individuals to implement the security requirements. 
What Is Examined 
Examination  includes  reviewing,  inspecting,  observing,  studying,  or  analyzing  assessment  
objects. The objects can be documents, mechanisms, or activities. 
For   some   security   requirements,   review   of   documentation may   assist   an   entity   in 
determining  if  the assessment  objectives  have  been  met.  Interviews  with  staff  may  help 
identify relevant documents. As set forth in 32 CFR § 170.24, documents need to be in their 
final  forms;  drafts  of  policies  or  documentation  are  not  eligible  to  be  used  as  evidence 
because they are not yet official and still subject to change. Common types of documents that 
may be used as evidence include: 
• policy, process, and procedure documents; 
• training materials; 
• plans and planning documents; and 
• system, network, and data flow diagrams. 
This list of documents is not exhaustive or prescriptive. An OSA may not have these specific 
documents, and other documents may be reviewed. 
In other cases, the security requirement is best self-assessed by observing that safeguards 
are in place by viewing hardware, associated configuration information, or observing staff 
following a process. 
What Is Tested 
Testing is an important part of the self-assessment process. Interviews provide information 
about   what   the   OSA   staff   believe   to   be   true,   documentation   provides   evidence   of   
implementing policies and procedures, and testing demonstrates what has or has not been 
done. For example, OSA staff may talk about how users are identified, documentation may 
provide details on how users are identified, but seeing a demonstration of identifying users 
provides evidence that the requirement is met. Not all security requirements utilize testing 
to allow an entity to determine if whether the assessment objective has been met.

Assessment Findings 
The self-assessment of a CMMC requirement results in one of three possible findings: MET, 
NOT MET,  or  NOT  APPLICABLE  as  defined  in  32  CFR  § 170.24.  To  demonstrate  Level  1 
compliance, the OSA will need a finding of MET or NOT APPLICABLE on all Level 1 security 
requirements. 
• MET:   All  applicable  objectives  for  the security  requirement  are  satisfied  based  on  
evidence. All  evidence  must  be  in  final  form  and  not  draft. Unacceptable  forms  of  
evidence include working papers, drafts, and unofficial or unapproved policies. For each 
security requirement marked MET, it is best practice to record statements that indicate 
the  response conforms  to  all  objectives  and  document  the  appropriate  evidence  to  
support the response. 
o Enduring Exceptions  when  described,  along  with  any  mitigations,  in  the  system  
security plan shall be assessed as MET. 
o Temporary deficiencies that are appropriately addressed in operational plans of 
action  (i.e.,  include  deficiency  reviews,  milestones,  and  show  progress  towards  
the    implementation    of    corrections    to    reduce    or    eliminate    identified    
vulnerabilities) shall be assessed as MET. 
• NOT MET: One or more objectives of the security requirement is not satisfied. For each 
security  requirement marked  NOT  MET, it  is  best  practice  to  record  statements  that  
explain  why  and  document  the  appropriate  evidence  showing that  the  OSA does  not  
conform fully to all of the objectives. 
• NOT APPLICABLE (N/A): A security requirement and/or objective do not apply at the 
time of the assessment. For each security requirement marked N/A, it is best practice to 
record a  statement  that  explains  why  the  requirement does  not  apply  to  the  OSA.  For 
example, SC.L1-b.1.xi might be N/A if there are no publicly accessible systems within the 
CMMC  Assessment  Scope.  During  an  assessment,  an  assessment  objective  assessed  as  
N/A is equivalent to the same assessment objective being assessed as MET. 
Each assessment  objective  in  NIST  SP  800-171A  must  yield  a  finding  of  MET  or  NOT  
APPLICABLE in order for the overall security requirement to be scored as MET. Assessors 
exercise  judgment  in  determining  when  sufficient  and  adequate  evidence  has  been  
presented to make an assessment finding. 
CMMC assessments are conducted and results are captured at the assessment objective 
level.  One  NOT  MET  Assessment  Objective results  in  a  failure  of  the  entire  security  
requirement. 
A security requirement can be applicable even when assessment objectives included in 
the  security  requirement  are  scored  N/A.  The  security  requirement  is  NOT  MET  when  
one or more applicable assessment objectives is NOT MET. 
Satisfaction  of  security  requirements  may  be  accomplished  by  other  parts  of  the  
enterprise or an External Service Provider (ESP), as defined in 32 CFR § 170.4. A security 
requirement is considered MET if adequate evidence is provided that the enterprise or

ESP implements the requirement objectives.   An ESP may be external people, technology, 
or  facilities  that  the  OSA uses,  including  cloud  service  providers,  managed  service  
providers, managed security service providers, or cybersecurity-as-a-service providers.

Requirement Descriptions 
Introduction 
This section provides detailed information and guidance for assessing each Level 1 security 
requirement.  The  section is  organized  first by  domain and  then  by  individual  security  
requirement.  Each  security  requirement  description  contains the  following  elements  as 
described in 32 CFR § 170.14(c): 
• Requirement    Number,    Name,    and    Statement:    Headed    by    the    requirement 
identification  number  in  the  format,  DD.L#-REQ  (e.g.,  AC.L1-b  .1.i);  followed  by  the  
requirement short name identifier, meant to be used for quick reference only; and finally 
followed by the complete CMMC security requirement statement. 
• Assessment Objectives [NIST SP 800-171A]: Identifies the specific set of objectives that 
must be met to receive MET for the requirement as defined in NIST SP 800-171A. 
• Potential Assessment Methods and Objects [ NIST SP 800-171A]: Describes the nature 
and  the  extent  of  the  self-assessment actions  as  set  forth  in  NIST  SP  800-171A.  The  
methods include examine, interview, and test. Self-a  ssessment objects identify the items 
being assessed and can include specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals. 
• Discussion [NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2]: Contains discussion from the associated NIST SP 
800-171 security requirement. Level 1 aligns with FAR Clause 52.204-21, which focuses 
on  FCI,  and  the  NIST  text  has  been  modified,  as  set  forth  in  32 CFR  §  170.15(c)(1),  to 
reflect this. 
• Further Discussion:  
o Expands upon the NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2 discussion content to provide additional 
guidance. 
o Contains examples illustrating application of the requirements. These examples are 
intended  to  provide  insight  but  are  not  intended  to  be  prescriptive  of  how  the  
requirement must be implemented, nor are they comprehensive of all assessment 
objectives  necessary  to  achieve  the  requirement. The  assessment objectives  met  
within the example are referenced by letter in a bracket (e.g., [a,d] for objectives “a” 
and “d”) within the text. 
o Examples are written from the perspective of an organization or an employee of 
an organization implementing solutions or researching approaches to satisfy

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]

Access   control   policies   (e.g.,   identity- or   role-based   policies,   control   matrices,   and   
cryptography)  control  access  between  active  entities  or  subjects  (i.e.,  users  or  processes  
acting  on  behalf  of  users)  and  passive  entities  or  objects  (e.g.,  devices,  files,  records,  and  
domains) in systems. Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application 
and service level to provide increased information security. Other systems include systems 
internal and external to the organization. This requirement focuses on account management 
for  systems  and  applications.  The  definition  of  and  enforcement  of  access  authorizations,  
other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses [sic] non-privileged) are 
addressed in AC.L1-b.1.ii. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Identify users, processes, and devices that are allowed to use company computers and can 
log on to the company network. Automated updates and other automatic processes should 
be  associated  with  the  user  who  initiated  (authorized)  the  process. Limit the devices  (e.g., 
printers)  that  can  be  accessed  by  company  computers.  Set  up  your  system  so  that  only 
authorized users, processes, and devices can access the company network. 
This  requirement,  AC.L1-b.1.i,  controls  system  access  based  on  user,  process,  or  device  
identity.  AC.L1-b.1.i leverages  IA.L1-b.1.v which  provides  a  vetted  and  trusted  identity  for  
access control. 
Example 1 
Your  company  maintains  a  list  of  all  personnel  authorized  to  use  company  information 
systems [a]. This list is used to support identification and authentication activities conducted 
by IT when authorizing access to systems [a,d]. 
Example 2 
A  coworker  wants  to  buy  a  new  multi-function  printer/scanner/fax  device  and  make  it  
available on the company network. You explain that the company controls system and device 
access to the network, and will prevent network access by unauthorized systems and devices 
[c]. You help the coworker submit a ticket that asks for the printer to be granted access to 
the network, and appropriate leadership approves the device [f]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Is a list of authorized users maintained that defines their identities and roles [a]?

Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type 
of account, or a combination of both. System account types include individual, shared, group, 
system,  anonymous,  guest,  emergency,  developer,  manufacturer,  vendor,  and  temporary. 
Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-
week,  and  point-of -origin.  In  defining  other  account  attributes,  organizations  consider  
system-related  requirements  (e.g.,  system  upgrades  scheduled  maintenance,)  and  mission  
or business  requirements,  (e.g.,  time  zone  differences,  customer  requirements,  remote  
access to support travel requirements).

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13 
16 
 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Limit users to only the information systems, roles, or applications they are permitted to use 
and require for their roles and responsibilities. Limit access to applications and data based 
on  authorized  users’   roles  and  responsibilities.  Common  types  of  functions  a  user  can  be  
assigned are create, read, update, and delete. 
Example 
You  supervise  the  team  that  manages  DoD  contracts  for  your  company.  Members  of  your  
team need to access the contract information to perform their work properly. Because some 
of that data contains FCI, you work with IT to set up your group’s systems so that users can 
be  assigned  access  based  on their  specific  roles  [a].  Each  role  limits  whether  an  employee  
has read-access or create/read/delete/update -access [b]. Implementing this access control 
restricts access to FCI information unless specifically authorized. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are access control lists used to limit access to applications and data based on role and/or 
identity [a]? 
• Is access for authorized users restricted to those parts of the system they are explicitly 
permitted  to  use,  that  is,  is  access  denied  by  default  and  allowed  by  exception (e.g.,  a  
person who only performs word-processing cannot access developer tools) [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]
10
 
External  systems  are  systems  or  components  of  systems  for  which  organizations  typically  
have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and 
controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. 
External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-
owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities.

This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or 
transmission  of  FCI,  including  accessing  cloud  services  (e.g.,  infrastructure  as  a  service,  
platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational systems. 
Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance 
with  organizational  security  policies  and  procedures.  Terms  and  conditions  address  as  a  
minimum,  the  types  of  applications  that  can  be  accessed  on  organizational  systems  from  
external  systems.  If  terms  and  conditions  with  the  owners  of  external  systems  cannot  be  
established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those 
external systems. 
This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external 
systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those 
situations,  organizations  need  confidence  that  the  external  systems  contain  the  necessary  
controls  so  as  not  to  compromise,  damage,  or  otherwise  harm  organizational  systems.  
Verification that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved 
by  third-party,  independent  assessments,  attestations,  or  other  means,  depending  on  the  
assurance or confidence level required by organizations. 
Note that while “external” typically refers to outside of the organization’s direct supervision 
and  authority,  that  is  not  always  the  case.  Regarding  the  protection  of  FCI  across  an  
organization,  the  organization  may  have  systems  that  process  FCI  and  others  that  do  not. 
And among the systems that process FCI there are likely access restrictions for FCI that apply 
between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within 
the organization may be considered “external" to that system. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Control  and  manage  connections  between  your  company  network  and  outside  networks. 
Outside  networks  could  include  the  public  internet,  one  of  your  own  company’s  networks  
that falls outside of your CMMC Assessment Scope (e.g., an isolated lab), or a network that 
does  not  belong  to  your  company.  Tools  to  manage  connections  include  firewalls  and  
connection  allow/deny  lists.  External  systems  not  controll ed  by  your company  could  be  
running  applications that  are  prohibited  or  blocked.  Control and  limit  access  to  corporate  
networks  from  personally  owned  devices such  as  laptops,  tablets,  and  phones.  You  may 
choose to limit how and when your network is connected to outside systems or only allow 
certain employees to connect to outside systems from network resources. 
Example 
Your  company  has  just  been  awarded  a  contract  which  contains  FCI.  You  remind  your  
coworkers of the policy requirement to use their company laptops, not personal laptops or 
tablets,  when  working  remotely  on  this  contract  [b,f]. You  also  remind  everyone  to  work  
from the cloud environment that is approved for processing and storing FCI rather than the 
other collaborative tools that may be used for other projects [b,f].

identified [b]? 
• Are  methods  employed  to  ensure  that  only  authorized  connections  are  being  made  to  
external systems (e.g., requiring log-ins or certificates, access from a specific IP address, 
or access via VPN) [c,e]? 
• Are methods employed to confirm that only authorized external systems are connecting 
(e.g.,  if  employees  are  receiving  company  email  on  personal  cell  phones,  is  the  OSA 
checking to verify that only known/expected devices are connecting) [d]? 
• Is the use of external systems limited, including by policy or physical control [f]?

are   controlled   by   the   organization   and   accessible   to   the   public,   typically   without   
identification or authentication. Individuals authorized to post FCI onto publicly accessible 
systems  are  designated.  The  content  of  information  is  reviewed  prior  to  posting  onto  
publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic information is not included. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Only  government  officials  can  be  authorized  to  publicly  release  FCI.  Do  not  allow  FCI  to  
become public – always safeguard the confidentiality of FCI by controlling the posting of FCI 
on  company-controlled  websites  or  public  forums  and  the  exposure  of  FCI  in  public  
presentations  or  on  public  displays.  It  is  important  to  know  which  users  are  allowed  to  
publish information   on   publicly   accessible   systems,   like   your   company   website,   and   
implement  a  review  process  before  posting  such  information.  If  FCI  is  discovered  on  a  
publicly  accessible  system,  procedures  should  be  in  place  to  remove  that  information  and  
alert the appropriate parties. 
Example 
Your company decides to start issuing press releases about its projects in an effort to reach 
more  potential  customers.  Your  company  receives  FCI  from  the  government  as  part  of  its  
DoD contract. Because you recognize the need to manage controlled information, including 
FCI, you meet with the employees who write the releases and post information to establish 
a review process [c]. It is decided that you will review press releases for FCI before posting 
it  on  the  company  website  [a,d]. Only  certain  employees  will  be  authorized  to  post  to  the  
website [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Does   information   on   externally   facing   systems   (e.g.,   publicly   accessible)   have   a   
documented approval chain for public release [c]?

Common  device  identifiers  include  media  access  control  (MAC), Internet  Protocol  (IP)  
addresses,  or  device-unique  token  identifiers.  Management  of  individual  identifiers  is  not  
applicable  to  shared  system  accounts.  Typically,  individual  identifiers  are  the  user  names  
associated  with  the  system  accounts  assigned  to  those  individuals.  Organizations  may  
require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability 
of individual activity. In addition, this requirement addresses individual identifiers that are 
not   necessarily   associated   with   system   accounts. Organizational   devices   requiring

identification  may  be  defined  by  type,  by  device,  or  by  a  combination  of  type/device. 
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Individual, unique identifiers (e.g., user names) should be assigned to all users and processes 
that access  company  systems.  Authorized  devices  also  should  have  unique  identifiers.  
Unique identifiers can be as simple as a short set of alphanumeric characters (e.g., SW001 
could refer to a network switch, SW002 could refer to a different network switch). 
This requirement, IA.L1-b.1.v, provides a vetted and trusted identity that supports the access 
control mechanism required by AC.L1-b.1.i. 
Example 
You  want  to  make  sure that  all  employees  working  on  a  project  can  access  important  
information  about  it.  Because  this  is  work  for  the  DoD  and  contains FCI,  you  also  need  to  
prevent  employees  who  are  not  working  on  that  project  from  being  able  to  access  the  
information.  You  assign  each  employee  a  unique  user  ID,  which  they  use  to  log  on  to  the 
system [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are unique identifiers issued to individual users (e.g., usernames) [a]? 
• Are the processes and service accounts that an authorized user initiates identified (e.g., 
scripts, automatic updates, configuration updates, vulnerability scans) [b]? 
• Are unique device identifiers used for devices that access the system identified [c]?

Individual   authenticators   include   the   following:   passwords,   key   cards,   cryptographic   
devices, and one-time password devices. Initial authenticator content is the actual content 
of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about 
authenticator  content  include  the  minimum  password  length.  Developers  ship  system  
components  with  factory  default  authentication  credentials  to  allow  for  initial  installation

and   configuration.   Default   authentication   credentials   are   often   well   known,   easily   
discoverable, and present a significant security risk. 
Systems    support    authenticator    management    by    organization-defined    settings    and

validation  time  window  for  time  synchronous  one-time  tokens,  and  number  of  allowed  
rejections   during   the   verification   stage   of   biometric   authentication.   Authenticator

temporary  access  such  as  that  required  for  remote  maintenance.  Device  authenticators  
include certificates and passwords. 
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Before a person or device is given system access, verify that the user or device is who or what 
it  claims  to  be.  This  verification  is  called  authentication.  The  most  common  way  to  verify  
identity is using a username and a hard-to-guess password. 
Some devices ship with a default username (e.g., admin) and password. A default username 
and password should be immediately changed to something unique. Default passwords may 
be  well  known  to  the  public, easily  found  in  a  search,  or  easy  to  guess, allowing an 
unauthorized person to access the system. 
Example 1 
You are in charge of purchasing laptops that will store FCI. You know that some laptops come 
with a default username and password. You notify IT that all default passwords should be 
reset  prior  to  laptop  use  [a].  You  ask  IT  to  explain  the  importance  of  resetting  default  
passwords and convey how easily they are discovered using internet searches during next 
week’s cybersecurity awareness training. 
Example 2 
Your  company  decides  to  use  cloud  services  for  email  and  other  capabilities  that  will  
transmit  FCI.  Upon  reviewing  this  requirement,  you  realize  every  user  or  device  that  
connects to the cloud service must be authenticated. As a result, you work with your cloud 
service provider to ensure that only properly authenticated users and devices are allowed 
to connect to the system [a,c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are unique authenticators used to verify user identities (e.g., usernames and passwords) 
[a]? 
• An example of a process acting on behalf of users could be a script that logs in as a person 
or service account [b]. Can the OSA show that it maintains a record of all of those service 
accounts for use when reviewing log data or responding to an incident?

This requirement applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or 
reuse.   Examples include:   digital   media   found   in   workstations,   network   components,   
scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, and mobile devices; and non-digital media 
such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media 
such  that  the  information  cannot  be  retrieved  or  reconstructed.  Sanitization  techniques,  
including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of 
information to unauthorized individuals when such media is released for reuse or disposal.

Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction 
may be necessary when other methods cannot be applied to the media requiring sanitization. 
Organizations use discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures 
for  media  containing  information  that  is  in  the  public  domain  or  publicly  releasable  or  
deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or 
disposal.   Sanitization   of   non-digital   media   includes   destruction,   removing   FCI   from   
documents,  or  redacting  selected  sections  or  words  from  a  document  by  obscuring  the  
redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing the words 
or  sections  from  the  document.  NARA  policy  and  guidance  control  sanitization  processes. 
NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Media can include a broad range of items that store information, including paper documents, 
disks, tapes, digital photography, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, and mobile phones. It is important 
to know what information is on media so that you can handle it properly. If there is FCI, you 
or someone in your company should either: 
• shred or destroy the device before disposal so it cannot be read; or  
• clean or purge the information, if you want to reuse the device. 
See NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, for more 
information. 
Example 
As you pack for an office move, you find some old CDs in a file cabinet. You determine that 
one  has  FCI  from a  project  your  company  did  for  the  DoD.  You  shred  the  CD  rather  than  
simply throwing it in the trash [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Is all managed data storage erased, encrypted, or destroyed using mechanisms to ensure 
that no usable data is retrievable [a,b]?

regulations, standards, procedures, and guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas 
within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible. 
Limiting  physical  access  to  equipment  may  include  placing  equipment  in  locked  rooms  or  
other  secured  areas  and  allowing  access  to  authorized  individuals  only,  and  placing  
equipment  in  locations  that  can  be  monitored  by  organizational  personnel.  Computing 
devices,  external  disk  drives,  networking  devices,  monitors,  printers,  copiers,  scanners,  
facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of equipment. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
This addresses the company’s physical space (e.g., office, testing environments, equipment 
rooms),   technical   assets,   and   non-technical   assets   that   need   to   be   protected   from   
unauthorized  physical  access.  Specific  environments  are  limited  to  authorized  employees, 
and access is controlled with badges, electronic locks, physical key locks, etc. 
Output devices, such as printers, are placed in areas where their use does not expose data to 
unauthorized  individuals.  Lists  of  personnel  with  authorized  access  are  developed  and  
maintained, and personnel are issued appropriate authorization credentials. 
Example 
You manage a DoD project that stores FCI on computers used only by project team members 
[b,c]. You work with the facilities manager to put locks on the doors to the areas where the 
computers are stored and used [b,c,d]. Project team members are the only individuals issued 
with keys to the space. This restricts access to only those employees who work on the DoD 
project and require access. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are  lists  of  personnel  with  authorized  access  developed  and  maintained,  and  are  
appropriate authorization credentials issued [a]? 
• Has the facility/building manager designated building areas as “sensitive” and designed 
physical security protections (e.g., guards, locks, cameras, card readers) to limit physical 
access to the area to only authorized employees [b,c,d]? 
• Are output devices such as printers placed in areas where their use does not expose data 
to unauthorized individuals [c]?

Organizations  have  flexibility  in  the  types  of  audit  logs  employed.  Audit  logs  can  be  
procedural (e.g., written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing 
ID  provided  by  a  Personal  Identity  Verification  (PIV)  card),  or  some  combination  thereof. 
Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems or 
system  components  requiring  supplemental  access  controls,  or  both.  System  components  
(e.g., workstations, notebook computers) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible 
with organizations safeguarding access to such devices. 
Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Do not allow visitors, even those people you know well, to walk around your facility without 
an escort. All non-employees should wear special visitor badges and/or are escorted by an 
employee at all times while on the property. 
Make sure you have a record of who accesses your facility (e.g., office, plant, factory). You can 
do  this  in  writing  by  having  employees  and  visitors  sign  in  and  sign  out  or  by  electronic  
means such as badge readers. Whatever means you use, you need to retain the access records 
for the time period that your company has defined. 
Identifying and controlling physical access devices (e.g., locks, badges, key cards) is just as 
important  as  monitoring  and  limiting  who  is  able  to  physically  access  certain  equipment. 
Physical access devices are only strong protection if you know who has them and what access 
they  allow.  Physical  access  devices  can  be  managed  using  manual  or  automatic  processes 
such a list of who is assigned what key, or updating the badge access system as personnel 
change roles. 
Example 1 
Coming  back  from  a  meeting,  you  see  the  friend  of  a  coworker  walking  down  the  hallway  
near your office where FCI is stored. You know this person well and trust them, but are not 
sure  why  they  are  in  the  building.  You  stop  to  talk,  and  the  person  explains  that  they  are  
meeting a coworker for lunch, but cannot remember where the lunchroom is. You walk the 
person back to the reception area to get a visitor badge and wait until someone can escort 
them  to  the  lunchroom  [a]. You  report  this  incident, and  the  company  decides  to  install  a  
badge reader at the main door so visitors cannot enter without an escort [a]. 
Example 2 
You  and  your  coworkers  like  to  have  friends  and  family  join  you  for  lunch  at  the  office  on  
Fridays. Your small company has just signed a contract with the DoD in which your company 
will receive FCI and you now need to document who enters and leaves your facility. You work 
with the reception staff to ensure that all non-employees sign in at the reception area and 
sign out when they leave [c]. You retain those paper sign-in sheets in a locked filing cabinet 
for one year. Employees receive badges or key cards that enable tracking and logging access 
to company facilities.

Example 3 
You are a facility manager. A team member retired today and returns their company keys to 
you.  The  project  on  which  they  were  working  requires access  to  areas  that  contain 
equipment with FCI. You receive the keys, check your electronic records against the serial 
numbers on the keys to ensure all have been returned, and mark each key returned [f]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are personnel required to accompany visitors to areas in a facility with physical access 
to organizational systems [a]? 
• Are visitors clearly distinguishable from regular personnel [b]? 
• Is visitor activity monitored (e.g., use of cameras or guards, reviews of secure areas upon 
visitor departure, review of visitor audit logs) [b]? 
• Are logs of physical access to sensitive areas (both authorized access and visitor access) 
maintained per retention requirements [c]? 
• Are visitor access records retained for as long as required [c]? 
• Are lists or inventories of physical access devices maintained (e.g., keys, facility badges, 
key cards) [d]? 
• Is  access  to  physical  access  devices  limited  (e.g.,  granted  to,  and  accessible  only  by,  
authorized individuals) [e]? 
• Are  physical  access  devices  managed (e.g., revoking  key  card  access  when  necessary,  
changing locks as needed, maintaining access control devices and systems) [f]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]
26
 
Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and 
by  restricting  or  prohibiting  interfaces  in  organizational  systems.  Boundary  components  
include  gateways,  routers,  firewalls,  guards,  network-based  malicious  code  analysis  and  
virtualization   systems,   or   encrypted   tunnels   implemented   within   a   system   security   
architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected 
subnetworks).  Restricting  or  prohibiting  interfaces  in  organizational  systems  includes  
restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed 
interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. 
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the 
implementation   of   security   requirements   associated   with   the   use   of   such   services. 
Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and 
consolidated  management  systems  shared  by  all  attached  commercial  customers  and  may  
also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission 
services  may  represent  sources  of  increased  risk  despite  contract  security  provisions. 
NIST SP 800-41  provides  guidance  on  firewalls  and  firewall  policy.  NIST SP  800-125B 
provides guidance on security for virtualization technologies. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Fences, locks, badges, and key cards help keep non-employees out of your physical facilities. 
Similarly,  your  company’s  IT  network  or  system  has  boundaries  that  must  be  protected. 
Many companies use a web proxy and a firewall. 
When  an  employee  uses  a  company  computer  to  go  to  a  website,  a  web  proxy  makes  the  
request  on  the  user’s  behalf,  looks  at  the  web  request,  and  decides  if  it  should  let  the  
employee go to the website. 
A firewall controls access from the inside and outside, protecting valuable information and 
resources stored on the company’s network. A firewall stops unwanted traffic on the internet 
from  passing  through  an  outside  “fence”  to  the  company’s  networks  and  information  
systems. Internal  boundaries  determine  where  data  can  flow,  for  instance  a  software  
development   environment   may   have   its   own   boundary   controlling,   monitoring,   and   
protecting the data that can leave that boundary. 
It may be wise to monitor, control, or protect one part of the company network from another. 
This  can  also  be  accomplished  with  a  firewall  and  limits  the  ability  of  attackers  and 
disgruntled employees from entering sensitive parts of your internal network and causing 
damage. 
Example 
You are setting up the new network with an FCI enclave. You start by sketching out a simple 
diagram that identifies the external boundary of your network and any internal boundaries 
that are  needed  [a,b].  The  first  piece  of  equipment  you  install  is  the  firewall,  a  device  to

separate your internal network from the internet. The firewall also has a feature that allows 
you to block access to potentially malicious websites, and you configure that service as well 
[a,c,e,g]. Some of your coworkers complain that they cannot get to certain websites [c,e,g]. 
You explain that the new network blocks websites that are known for spreading malware. 
The firewall sends you a daily digest of blocked activity so that you can monitor the system 
for attack trends [c,d]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• What  are the external system boundary components  that  make  up  the  entry  and  exit 
points for data flow (e.g., firewalls, gateways, cloud service boundaries), behind which all 
system components that handle regulated data are contained? What are the supporting 
system components necessary for the protection of regulated data [a]? 
• What  are  the internal system boundary components  that  make  up  the  entry  and  exit  
points  for  key  internal  data  flow  (e.g.,  internal  firewalls,  routers,  any  devices  that  can  
bridge  the  connection  between  one  segment  of  the  system  and  another)  that separate 
segments  of  the  internal  network  – including  devices  that  separate  internal  network  
segments such as development and production networks as well as a traditional DMZ at 
the edge of the network [b]? 
• Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries monitored 
(e.g., connections are logged and able to be reviewed, suspicious traffic generates alerts) 
[c,d]? 
• Is  data traversing the  external  and  internal  system  boundaries  controlled  such  that  
connections are denied by default and only authorized connections are allowed [e,f]? 
• Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries protected 
(e.g., applying encryption when required or prudent, tunneling traffic as needed) [g,h]?

FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Publicly accessible systems should be separated from the internal systems that need to be 
protected. Internal systems should not be placed on the same network as publicly accessible 
systems, and access by default from DMZ networks to internal networks should be blocked. 
One method of accomplishing this is to create a DMZ network, which enhances security by 
providing  public  access  to  a  specific  set  of  resources  while  preventing  connections  from  
those resources to the rest of the IT environment. Some OSAs may achieve a similar result 
through  the  use  of  a  cloud  computing  environment  that  is  separated  from  the  rest  of  the 
company’s infrastructure. 
Example 
The head of recruiting at your firm wants to launch a website to post job openings and allow 
the public to download an application form [a]. After some discussion, your team realizes it 
needs  to  use  a  firewall  to  create  a  perimeter  network  to  do  this  because  your  network  
contains FCI [b]. You host the server separately from the company’s internal network where 
FCI  is  stored  and  make  sure  the  network  on  which  it  resides  is  isolated  with  the  proper  
firewall rules [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are  any  system  components  reachable  by  the  public  (e.g.,  internet-facing  web  servers,  
VPN gateways, publicly accessible cloud services) [a]? 
• Are   publicly   accessible   system   components   on   physically   or   logically   separated   
subnetworks (e.g., isolated subnetworks using separate, dedicated VLAN segments such 
as DMZs) [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2]
30
 
Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws 
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to 
designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates 
include  patches,  service  packs,  hot  fixes,  and  anti-virus  signatures.  Organizations  address  
flaws  discovered  during  security  assessments,  continuous  monitoring,  incident  response  
activities,   and   system   error   handling.   Organizations   can   take   advantage   of   available   
resources  such  as  the  Common  Weakness  Enumeration  (CWE)  database  or  Common  
Vulnerabilities   and   Exposures   (CVE)   database   in   remediating   flaws   discovered   in   
organizational systems. 
Organization-defined  time  periods  for  updating  security-relevant  software  and  firmware  
may vary based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of 
the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require 
more testing than other types of remediation. NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on patch 
management technologies. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
All software and firmware have potential flaws. Many vendors work to remedy those flaws 
by  releasing  vulnerability  information  and  updates  to  their  software  and  firmware.  OSAs 
should have a process to review relevant vendor notifications and updates about problems 
or  weaknesses.  After  reviewing  the  information,  the  OSA   should implement  a patch 
management process that  allows  for  software  and  firmware  flaws  to  be  fixed  without 
adversely  affecting  the  system  functionality.   OSAs should define  the  time  frames  within  
which flaws are identified, reported, and corrected for all systems. 
Example 
You know that software vendors typically release patches, service packs, hot fixes, etc. and 
want to make sure your software that processes FCI is up to date. You develop a policy that 
requires checking vendor websites for flaw notifications every week [a]. The policy further 
requires that those flaws be assessed for severity and patched on end-user computers once 
each week and servers once each month [c,e]. Consistent with that policy, you configure the 
system to check for updates weekly or daily depending on the criticality of the software [b,e]. 
Your team reviews available updates and implements the applicable ones according to the 
defined schedule [f].

Trojan  horses,  and  spyware.  Malicious  code  can  be  encoded  in  various  formats  (e.g.,  
UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using 
techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety 
of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable 
storage   devices. Malicious   code   insertions   occur   through   the   exploitation   of   system   
vulnerabilities. 
Malicious   code   protection   mechanisms   include   anti-virus   signature   definitions   and   
reputation-based  technologies.  A  variety  of  technologies  and  methods  exist  to  limit  or  
eliminate   the   effects   of   malicious   code.   Pervasive   configuration   management   and   
comprehensive  software  integrity  controls  may  be  effective  in  preventing  execution  of  
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also 
be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other 
types   of   cyber-attacks   that   could   affect   organizational   missions/business   functions. 
Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these 
situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, 
configuration  management  and  control,  trusted  procurement  processes,  and  monitoring  
practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions 
intended. NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on malware incident prevention. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Malicious code purposely performs unauthorized activity that undermines the security of an 
information system. A designated location may be a network device such as a firewall or an 
end user’s computer. 
Malicious code, which can be delivered by a range of means (e.g., email, removable media, or 
websites), includes the following: 
• Virus – program designed to cause damage, steal information, change data, send email, 
show messages, or any combination of these things; 
• Spyware – program designed to secretly gather information about a person’s activity;  
• Trojan Horse – type of malware made to look like legitimate software and used by cyber 
criminals to get access to a company’s systems; and 
• Ransomware – type of malware that threatens to publish the victim’s data or perpetually 
block access to it unless a ransom is paid. 
Consider use of anti-malware tools to stop or lessen the impact of malicious code. 
Example 
Your  company’s  IT  team  is  buying  new  computers  and  wants to  protect  your  company’s  
information  from  viruses  and  spyware.  The  computers  will  be  used  to  process,  store,  and  
transmit  FCI.  They research  anti-malware  products,  select  an  appropriate  solution,  and 
deploy antivirus software on all hosts for which satisfactory antivirus software is available 
[a,b].

FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Malware  changes  on  an  hourly  or  daily  basis,  and  it  is  important  to  update  detection  and  
protection mechanisms frequently to maintain the effectiveness of the protection.

You have  installed  anti-malware  software  to  protect  a  computer  that  stores  FCI  from 
malicious  code.  Knowing  that  malware  evolves  rapidly,  you  configure  the  software  to  
automatically check for malware definition updates every day and update as needed [a].

of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable 
storage   devices.   Malicious   code   insertions   occur   through   the   exploitation   of   system

FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Consider  use of  anti-malware  software  to  scan  for viruses  in  your computer  systems  and  
determine how often scans are conducted. Real-time scans look at the system whenever files 
are  downloaded,  opened,  and  saved. Periodic  scans  check  previously  saved  files  against 
updated malware information. Anti-malware software should be installed, run, and updated 
on all hosts for which satisfactory antivirus software is available. 
Example 
Your company transmits FCI over email. You work with your company’s email provider to 
enable enhanced protections that will scan all attachments to identify and quarantine those 
that may  be  harmful  prior  to  a  user  opening  them  [c].  In  addition,  you  configure antivirus 
software  on  each  computer  to  scan  for  malicious  code  every  day  [a,b].  The  software  also  
scans  files  that  are  downloaded  or  copied  from  removable  media  such  as  USB  drives.  It 
quarantines any suspicious files and notifies the security team [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are  files  from  media  (e.g.,  USB  drives,  CD-ROM)  included  in  the  definition  of  external  
sources and are they being scanned [c]?
