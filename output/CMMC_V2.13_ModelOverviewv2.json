The  three  columns  list  the associated  security  requirements  for  each  CMMC level.  Each  level  is  independent  and consists of a set of CMMC security requirements: •Level 1: the basic safeguarding requirements for FCI specified in FAR Clause 52.204-21. •Level 2: the security requirements for CUI specified in NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 per DFARS Clause 252.204-7012 •Level  3:  selected enhanced security  requirements for  CUI  specified  in  NIST  SP  800-172 with DoD-approved parameters where applicable. Each requirement is  contained  in  a  single  cell.  The requirement  identification  number  is bolded at the top of each cell. The next line contains the requirement short name identifier, in italics,  which  is  meant  to  be  used  for  quick  reference  only.  Below  the  short  name  is  the complete  CMMC  security  requirement statement. Some  Level  3  requirement  statements contain  a  DoD-approved  parameter,  which  is  underlined.  Finally,  the  bulleted  list  at  the bottom  contains  the  FAR  Clause  52.204-21, NIST  SP  800-171  Rev  2,  and  NIST  SP  800-172 reference as appropriate.
