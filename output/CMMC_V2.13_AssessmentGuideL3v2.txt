Introduction 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
1 
 
Introduction 
This document provides guidance in the preparation for and conduct of a Level 3 certification 
assessment under the  Cybersecurity  Maturity  Model  Certification  (CMMC)  Program  as  set  
forth  in  section  170.18  of  title  32,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR).  Certification  at  each  
CMMC level occurs independently. Guidance for conducting a Level 1 self-assessment can be 
found  in  CMMC  Assessment  Guide  – Level  1.  Guidance  for  conducting  both  a  Level  2  self-
assessment and Level 2 certification assessment, can be found in CMMC Assessment Guide – 
Level 2. More details on the model can be found in the CMMC Model Overview document. 
An Assessment as defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 means the testing or evaluation of security controls 
to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, 
and  producing  the  desired  outcome  with  respect  to  meeting  the  security  requirements  for  an  
information system,  or organization as defined in 32 CFR § 170.15 to 32 CFR § 170.18. A Level 
3  certification assessment  as  defined  in 32 CFR  §  170.4 is  the  activity  performed  by  the  
Department  of  Defense  (DoD) to  evaluate  the  CMMC  level  of  an  Organization  Seeking  
Certification (OSC). For Level 3, assessments are conducted exclusively by the DCMA DIBCAC. 
An OSC seeking a Level 3 certification assessment must have first achieved a CMMC Status of 
Final Level  2  (C3PAO),  as  set  forth  in 32 CFR  §  170.18(a), for  all  applicable  information  
systems within  the  CMMC  Assessment Scope, and the  OSC  must  implement  the  Level  3  
requirements specified in 32 CFR § 170.14(c)(4). This is followed by the Level 3 certification 
assessment conducted by the DCMA DIBCAC. 
OSCs may   also   use   this   guide   to   perform   Level   3 self-assessments (for  example,  in  
preparation for an annual affirmation); however, they are not eligible to submit results from 
a self-assessment in support of a Level 3 certification assessment. Only the results from an 
assessment  by  DCMA DIBCAC are  considered for award of the CMMC Statuses Conditional 
Level 3 (DIBCAC) or Final Level 3 (DIBCAC).   Level 3 reporting and affirmation requirements 
can be found in 32 CFR § 170.18 and 32 CFR § 170.22. 
Level 3 Description 
Level  3 consists  of  selected  security  requirements  derived  from  National  Institute  of  
Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  Special  Publication  (SP)  800-172, Enhanced  Security  
Requirements  for  Protecting  Controlled  Unclassified  Information:  A  Supplement  to  NIST  
Special Publication 800-171, with DoD-approved parameters where applicable. Level 3 only 
applies to systems that have already achieved a Final Level 2 (C3PAO) CMMC Status. Level 2 
consists  of  the  security  requirements  specified  in  NIST  SP  800-171, Protecting  Controlled  
Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations. 

 
Introduction 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
2 
 
Like Level 2 , Level 3 addresses the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), as 
defined in 32 CFR § 2002.4(h): 
Information  the  Government  creates  or  possesses,  or  that  an  entity  creates  or  
possesses  for  or  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  that  a  law,  regulation,  or  
Government-wide   policy   requires   or   permits   an   agency   to   handle   using   
safeguarding or dissemination controls. However, CUI does not include classified 
information (see paragraph (e) of this section) or information a non-executive 
branch entity possesses and maintains in its own systems that did not come from, 
or was not created or possessed by or for, an executive branch agency or an entity 
acting for an agency. Law, regulation, or Government-wide policy may require 
or  permit  safeguarding  or  dissemination  controls  in  three  ways:  Requiring  or  
permitting  agencies  to  control  or  protect  the  information  but  providing  no  
specific   controls,   which   makes   the   information   CUI   Basic;   requiring   or   
permitting agencies to control or protect the information and providing specific 
controls for doing so, which makes the information CUI Specified; or requiring or 
permitting agencies to control the information and specifying only some of those 
controls, which makes the information CUI Specified, but with CUI Basic controls 
where the authority does not specify. 
Level  3 provides additional  protections  against  advanced  persistent  threats  (APTs), and 
increased   assurance to   the   DoD   that   an OSC   can   adequately   protect   CUI   at   a   level   
commensurate  with  the  adversarial risk, to  include  protecting  information  flow  with  the  
government and with subcontractors in a multitier supply chain. 
Purpose and Audience 
This guide is intended for assessors, OSCs, cybersecurity professionals, and individuals and 
companies that support CMMC efforts. This document can be used as part of preparation for 
and conducting a Level 3 certification assessment. 
Document Organization 
This document is organized into the following sections: 
• Assessment   and   Certification: provides   an   overview   of   the   Level   3   assessment 
processes set  forth  in  32  CFR  §  170.18.  It  provides  guidance  regarding  the  scope  
requirements set forth in 32 CFR § 170.19(d). 
• CMMC-Custom  Terms:  incorporates  definitions  from  32  CFR  § 170.4,  definitions  
included by reference from 32 CFR § 170.2, and provides clarification of the intent and 
scope of specific terms as used in the context of CMMC. 
• Assessment   Criteria   and   Methodology: provides   guidance   on   the   criteria   and   
methodology  (i.e.,  interview, examine,  and  test) to  be  employed  during  a  Level  3  
assessment, as well as on assessment findings.

requirement. 

 
Assessment and Certification 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
4 
 
Assessment and Certification 
The DCMA DIBCAC will use the assessment methods defined in NIST SP 800-172A
1
, Assessing 
Enhanced  Security  Requirements  for  Controlled  Unclassified  Information,  along  with  the 
supplemental   information   in   this   guide   to   conduct   Level 3   certification assessments. 
Assessors will  review  information  and  evidence  to  verify  that  an OSC  meets  the  stated  
assessment objectives for all of the requirements. 
An OSC can obtain a Level 3 certification assessment for an entire enterprise network or for 
specific enclave(s), depending on how the CMMC Assessment Scope is defined in accordance 
with 32 CFR § 170.19(d). 
Assessment Scope 
Prior to conducting a CMMC Level 3 certification assessment, the Level 3 CMMC Assessment 
Scope must be defined as addressed in 32 CFR § 170.19(d) and the CMMC Scoping Guide – 
Level 3 document
2
.  The  CMMC  Assessment  Scope  informs  which  assets  within  the  OSC’s 
environment will be assessed and the details of the assessment. The OSC must have achieved 
a  CMMC  Status  of  Final Level  2  (C3PAO) of  all  systems  included  within  the  Level  3  CMMC 
Assessment Scope prior to requesting the Level 3 assessment, as set forth in 32 CFR § 170.18. 
The Level 3 assessment scoping is based on the requirements defined in 32 CFR § 170.19(d) 
and supported by the CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 3 document. The CMMC Scoping Guide – 
Level 3 document    is    available    on    the    official    CMMC    documentation    site    at    
https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Documentation/.  If  a  Final Level  2  (C3PAO)  CMMC  
Status has not already been achieved for the desired CMMC Assessment Scope, the OSC may 
not proceed with the Level 3 assessment.

 Note that an OSC ought to be mindful of their full Level 3 scoping in their request for a Level 2 assessment. 

 
CMMC-Custom Terms 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
5 
 
CMMC-Custom Te r m s 
The CMMC Program has custom terms that align with program requirements. Although some 
terms may have other definitions in open forums, it is important to understand these terms 
as they apply to the CMMC Program. 
The custom terms associated with Level 3 are: 
• Assessment: As  defined  32 CFR §  170.4 means  the  testing  or  evaluation  of  security  
controls  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the  controls  are  implemented  correctly,  
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the 
security  requirements  for  an  information  system  or  organization defined  in  32  CFR  § 
170.15 to 32 CFR § 170.18. 
o Level 3 certification assessment is the term for the activity performed by the DCMA 
DIBCAC to evaluate the information system of an OSC when seeking a CMMC Status of 
Level 3 (DIBCAC). 
o POA&M closeout certification assessment is the term for the activity performed by a 
C3PAO  or  DCMA  DIBCAC  to  evaluate  only  the  NOT  MET  requirements  that  were  
identified with POA&M during the initial assessment, when seeking a CMMC Status of 
Final Level 2 (C3PAO) or Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) respectively. 
• Assessment  Objective:  Means a  set  of  determination  statements  that,  taken  together,  
expresses the desired outcome for the assessment of a security requirement. Successful 
implementation of the corresponding CMMC security requirement requires meeting all 
applicable assessment objectives defined in NIST SP 800–171A or NIST SP 800-172A. 
• Asset: Means an item of value to stakeholders. An asset may be tangible (e.g., a physical 
item   such   as   hardware,   firmware,   computing   platform,   network   device,   or   other   
technology   component)   or   intangible   (e.g.,   humans,   data,   information,   software,   
capability,  function,  service,  trademark,  copyright,  patent,  intellectual  property,  image,  
or reputation). The value of an asset is determined by stakeholders in consideration of 
loss  concerns  across  the  entire  system  life  cycle.  Such  concerns  include  but  are  not  
limited to business or mission concerns. Understanding assets is critical to identifying the 
CMMC Assessment Scope; for more information see CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 3. 
• CMMC Assessment Scope: As defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 means the set of all assets in the 
OSC’s environment that will be assessed against CMMC security requirements. 
• CMMC Status: The result of meeting or exceeding the minimum required score for the 
corresponding assessment. The CMMC Status of an OSA information system is officially 
stored  in  SPRS  and  additionally  presented  on  a  Certificate  of  CMMC  Status,  if  the  
assessment was conducted by a C3PAO or DCMA DIBCAC. 
o Conditional Level  3  (DIBCAC): Defined  in 32 CFR  §  170.18(a)(1)(ii).  The  OSC  will 
achieve CMMC  Status  of Conditional  Level  3  (DIBCAC)  if  a  POA&M  exists  upon  
completion of the assessment and the POA&M meets all Level 3 POA&M requirements 
listed in 32 CFR § 170.21(a)(3). 

 
CMMC-Custom Terms 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
6 
 
• Final Level 3 (DIBCAC): Defined in 32 CFR § 170.18(a)(1)(iii). The OSC will achieve 
Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) CMMC Status for the information systems within the CMMC 
Assessment   Scope   upon   implementation   of   all   security   requirements   and,   if   
applicable a POA&M closeout assessment within 180 days. Additional guidance can 
be found in 32 CFR §170.21. 
• Enduring Exception: As defined 32 CFR § 170.4 means a special circumstance or 
system where remediation and full compliance with CMMC security requirements is not 
feasible. Examples include systems required to replicate the configuration of ‘fielded’ 
systems, medical devices, test equipment, OT, and IoT. No operational plan of action is 
required but the circumstance must be documented within a system security plan. 
Specialized Assets and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)   may be Enduring 
Exceptions. 
• Event: Any observable occurrence in a system
3
. As described in NIST SP 800-171A
4
, the 
terms “information system” and “system” can be used interchangeably. Events sometimes 
provide indication that an incident is occurring. 
• Incident: An occurrence  that  actually  or  potentially  jeopardizes  the  confidentiality,  
integrity, or availability of a system or the information the system processes, stores, or 
transmits  or  that  constitutes  a  violation  or  imminent  threat  of  violation  of  security  
policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.
5
 
• Monitoring: The   act   of   continually   checking,   supervising,   critically   observing,   or   
determining the status in order to identify change from the performance level required 
or expected at an organization-defined frequency and rate.
6
 
• Operational  plan  of  action: As used  in  security  requirement  CA.L2-3.12.2,  means  the  
formal artifact which identifies temporary vulnerabilities and temporary deficiencies in 
implementation of requirements and documents how and when they will be mitigated, 
corrected,  or  eliminated.  The  OSA  defines  the  format  (e.g.,  document,  spreadsheet,  
database)  and  specific  content  of  its  operational  plan  of  action. An  operational  plan  of  
action is not the same as a POA&M associated with an assessment. 
• Organization-defined: As  determined  by  the  OSC  being assessed except  as  defined  in  
the case of Organization-Defined Parameter (ODP). This can be applied to a frequency or 
rate at which something occurs within a given time period, or it could be associated with 
describing the configuration of a OSC’s solution. 
• Organization-Defined Parameters (ODPs): Selected enhanced security requirements 
contain selection and assignment operations to give organizations
7
 flexibility in defining 
variable parts of those requirements, as defined in NIST SP 800-172A. ODPs are used in 
NIST SP 800-172 and NIST SP 800-172A to allow Federal agencies, in this case the DoD, 
to  customize  security  requirements.  Once  specified,  the  values  for  the  assignment  and  
selection  operations  become  part  of  the  requirement  and  objectives,  where  applicable.

The  assignments  and  selections  chosen  for  Level  3  are  underlined  in  the  requirement  
statement and objectives. In some cases, further specificity of the assignment or selection 
will need to be made by the OSC. In those cases, the term and abbreviation ODPs is used 
in the assessment objectives to denote where additional definition is required. 
• Periodically: Means occurring at a regular interval as determined by the OSA that may 
not exceed one year.  As used in many requirements within CMMC, the interval length is 
organization-defined to  provide  OSC flexibility, with an interval length of no more than 
one year. 
• Security Protection Data: As defined 32 CFR § 170.4 means data stored or processed by 
Security Protection Assets (SPA) that are used to protect an OSC's assessed environment. 
Security Protection Data is security relevant information and includes, but is not limited 
to: configuration data required to operate an SPA, log files generated by or ingested by 
an  SPA,  data  related  to  the  configuration  or  vulnerability  status  of  in-scope  assets,  and  
passwords that grant access to the in-scope environment. 
• System Security Plan (SSP): Means the formal document that provides an overview of 
the security requirements for an information system or an information security program 
and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. 
The system security plan describes the system components that are included within the 
system, the environment in which the system operates, how the security requirements 
are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems. 
• Temporary deficiency: 
As defined 32 CFR § 170.4 means a condition where 
remediation of a discovered deficiency is feasible and a known fix is available or is in 
process. The deficiency must be documented in an operational plan of action. A 
temporary deficiency is not based on an ‘in progress’ initial implementation of a CMMC 
security requirement but arises after implementation. A temporary deficiency may 
apply during the initial implementation of a security requirement if, during roll-out, 
specific issues with a very limited subset of equipment is discovered that must be 
separately addressed. There is no standard duration for which a temporary deficiency 
may be active. For example, FIPS-validated cryptography that requires a patch and the 
patched version is no longer the validated version may be a temporary deficiency. 
 

 
Assessment Criteria and Methodology 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13

Assessment Criteria and Methodology 
The CMMC  Assessment  Guide  – Level  3  leverages  the  assessment  procedure  described  in  
NIST SP 800-172A Section 2.1: 
An  assessment  procedure  consists  of  an  assessment  objective  and  a  set  of  
potential  assessment  methods  and  objects  that  can  be  used  to  conduct  the  
assessment.   Each   assessment   objective   includes   a   set   of   determination 
statements related to the CUI enhanced security requirement that is the subject 
of  the  assessment.  Organization-defined  parameters  (ODP)  that  are  part  of  
selected    enhanced    security    requirements    are    included    in    the    initial    
determination statements for the assessment procedure. ODPs are included since 
the    specified    parameter    values    are    used    in    subsequent    determination    
statements. ODPs are numbered sequentially and noted in bold italics. 
Determination   statements   reflect   the   content   of   the   enhanced   security 
requirements    to    ensure    traceability    of    the    assessment    results    to    the    
requirements.  The  application  of  an  assessment  procedure  to  an  enhanced  
security  requirement  produces  assessment  findings.  The  findings  are  used  to  
determine if the enhanced security requirement has been satisfied. 
Assessment objects are associated with the specific items being assessed. These 
objects can include specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals. 
• Specifications  are  the  document-based  artifacts  (e.g.,  policies,  procedures, 
security plans, security requirements, functional specifications, architectural 
designs) associated with a system. 
• Mechanisms  are  the  specific  hardware,  software,  or  firmware  safeguards  
employed within a system. 
• Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that involve 
people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, exercising a contingency 
plan, and monitoring network traffic). 
• Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the specifications, 
mechanisms, or activities described above. 
Assessment  methods  define  the  nature  and  the  extent  of  the  assessor’s  actions.  
The methods include examine, interview, and test. 
• The examine  method  is  the  process  of  reviewing,  inspecting,  observing,  
studying,  or  analyzing  assessment  objects  (i.e.,  specifications,  mechanisms,  
activities). 
• The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals 
or groups of individuals to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or 
obtain evidence. 

 
Assessment Criteria and Methodology 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13

• The test method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, 
mechanisms)  under  specified  conditions  to  compare  actual  with  expected  
behavior. 
The  purpose  of  the  assessment  methods  is  to  facilitate  understanding,  achieve  
clarification,  and  obtain  evidence.  The  results  obtained  from  applying  the  
methods  are  used  for  making  the  specific  determinations  called  for  in  the  
determination   statements   and   thereby   achieving   the   objectives   for   the   
assessment procedure. 
Criteria 
Assessment objectives are provided for each requirement and are based on existing criteria 
from NIST SP 800-172A. The criteria are authoritative and provide a basis for the assessor 
to conduct an assessment of a requirement. 
Methodology 
During the CMMC certification assessment, the assessor will verify and validate that the OSC 
has met the requirements. Because an OSC c an meet the assessment objectives in different 
ways  (e.g.,  through  documentation,  computer  configuration,  network  configuration,  or  
training), the assessor may use a variety of techniques, including one or more of the three 
assessment methods described above from NIST SP 800-172A, to determine if the OSC meets 
the intent of the requirements. 
The  assessor  will  follow  the  guidance  in  NIST SP  800-172A  when  determining  which  
assessment methods to use: 
Organizations [DoD] are not expected to use all of the assessment methods and 
objects    contained    within    the    assessment    procedures    identified    in    this    
publication.  Rather,  organizations  have  the  flexibility  to  establish  the  level  of  
effort   needed   and   the   assurance   required   for   an   assessment   (e.g.,   which   
assessment methods and objects are deemed to be the most useful in obtaining 
the  desired  results).  The  decision  on  level  of  effort  is  made  based  on  how  the  
organization can accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective 
and efficient manner and with sufficient confidence to support the determination 
that the CUI enhanced security requirements have been satisfied. 
The primary deliverable of an assessment is a compliance score and accompanying report 
that contains the findings associated with each requirement. For more detailed information 
on assessment methods, see Appendix C of NIST SP 800-172A. 
Figure 1 illustrates an example of an assessment procedure for requirement AC.L3-3.1.3e.

Who Is Interviewed 
The  assessor  has  discussions  with  OSC  staff  to  understand  if  a  requirement  has  been  
addressed.  Interviews  with applicable  staff  (possibly  at  different  organizational  levels)  
determine  if  CMMC  security requirements  are  implemented  and if  adequate  resourcing,  
training, and planning have occurred for individuals to perform the requirements. 
What Is Examined 
Examination  includes  reviewing,  inspecting,  observing,  studying,  or  analyzing  assessment  
objects. The objects can be documents, mechanisms, or activities. The primary focus will be 
to examine through demonstrations during interviews. 
For  some  requirements,  the  assessor  reviews  documentation  to  determine  if  assessment  
objectives are met. Interviews with OSC staff may identify the documents uses. Documents 
need to be in their final forms; working papers (e.g., drafts) of documentation are not eligible 
to be submitted as evidence because they are not yet official and are still subject to change. 
Common types of documents that can be used as evidence include: 
• policy, process, and procedure documents; 
• training materials; 
• plans and planning documents; and 
• system-level, network, and data flow diagrams. 

 
Assessment Criteria and Methodology 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
11 
 
This list of documents is not exhaustive or prescriptive. An OSC may not have these specific 
documents, and other documents may be used to provide evidence of compliance. 
In other cases, the requirement is best assessed by observing that safeguards are in place by 
viewing  hardware  or  associated  configuration  information  or  observe staff exercising  a 
process. 
What Is Tested 
Testing is an important part of the assessment process. Interviews tell the assessor what the 
OSC  staff  believe  to  be  true,  documentation  provides  evidence  of  intent,  and  testing  
demonstrates what has or has not been done and is the preferred assessment method when 
possible. For example, staff may talk about how users are identified and documentation may 
provide details on how users are identified, but seeing a demonstration of user identification 
provides   evidence   that   the   requirement   is   met.   The   assessor   will   determine   which   
requirements  or  objectives  within  a  requirement  need  demonstration  or  testing.  Most  
objectives will require testing. 
Assessment Findings 
The  assessment  of  a  CMMC    security requirement  results  in  one  of  three  possible  findings:  
MET, NOT MET, or NOT APPLICABLE as defined in 32 CFR § 170.24. To achieve CMMC Status 
of Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) as described in 32 CFR § 170.18, the OSC will need a finding of MET 
or NOT APPLICABLE on all Level 3 security requirements.  
• MET:  All  applicable  assessment objectives  for  the  security  requirement  are  satisfied 
based on evidence. All evidence must be in final form and a not draft. Unacceptable forms 
of  evidence  include  working  papers,  drafts,  and  unofficial  or  unapproved  policies.  For 
each  security  requirement  marked  MET,  it  is  best  practice  to  record  statements  that  
indicate the response conforms to all objectives and document the appropriate evidence 
to support the response. 
• Enduring Exceptions  when  described,  along  with  any  mitigations,  in  the  system  
security plan shall be assessed as MET. 
• Temporary deficiencies that are appropriately addressed in operational plans of 
action  (i.e.,  include  deficiency  reviews,  milestones,  and  show  progress  towards  
the    implementation    of    corrections    to    reduce    or    eliminate    identified    
vulnerabilities) shall be assessed as MET. 
• NOT MET: One or more objectives for the security requirement is not satisfied. During a 
Level 3 certification assessment, for each requirement objective marked NOT MET, the 
assessor will document why the evidence provided by the OSC does not conform. 
• NOT APPLICABLE (N/A): A security requirement and/or objective does not apply at the 
time of the assessment. For example, SI.L3-3.14.3e might be N/A if there are no Internet of 
Things   (IoT), Industrial   Internet   of   Things   (IIoT), Operational   Technology   (OT),

Government   Furnished   Equipment   (GFE),   Restricted   Information   Systems,   or   test 
equipment included in the Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope. 
If an OSC previously received a favorable adjudication from the DoD CIO indicating that 
a  requirement  is  not  applicable  or  that  an  alternative  security  measure  is  equally  
effective,  the  DoD  CIO adjudication  must  be  included  in  the  system  security  plan  to  
receive    consideration    during    an    assessment.    Implemented    security    measures    
adjudicated by the DoD CIO as equally effective are assessed as MET if there have been 
no changes in the environment. 
Each assessment objective  in  NIST  SP  800-171A and  NIST  SP  800-172A must  yield  a  
finding of MET or NOT APPLICABLE in order for the overall security requirement to be 
scored   as   MET.   Assessors   exercise   judgment   in   determining   when   sufficient   and   
adequate evidence has been presented to make an assessment finding. 
CMMC certification assessments   are   conducted   and   results   are   captured   at   the   
assessment objective level. One NOT MET assessment objective results in a failure of the 
entire security requirement. 
A security requirement can be applicable even when assessment objectives included in 
the security requirements are scored as N/A. The security requirement is NOT MET when 
one or more applicable assessment objectives is NOT MET. 
Satisfaction of security requirements may be accomplished by other parts of the enterprise 
or an External Service Provider (ESP), as defined in 32 CFR § 170.4. A security requirement 
is considered MET if adequate evidence is provided that the enterprise or ESP, implements 
the requirement  objectives. An  ESP  may  be  external  people,  technology,  or  facilities  that  
the OSC  uses,  including  cloud  service  providers,  managed  service  providers,  managed  
security service providers, or cybersecurity-as-a-service providers. 

 
Requirement Descriptions 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13

Requirement Descriptions 
This section provides detailed information and guidance for assessing each Level 3 security 
requirement.  The  section  is  organized  first by  domain  and  then by  individual  security  
requirement.  Each  security requirement  description  contains  the  following  elements  as 
described in 32 CFR § 170.14(c): 
• Requirement Number, Name, and Statement: Headed by the requirement identification 
number in the format DD.L#-REQ (e.g., AC.L3-3.1.2e); followed by the requirement short 
name  identifier,  meant  to  be  used  for  quick  reference  only;  and  finally  followed  by  the  
complete  CMMC  security requirement  statement. In  the  case  where  the  original NIST SP 
800-172  requirement  requires  an  assignment  and/or  selection  statement,  the  Level  3  
assignment  (and  any  necessary  selection)  text is emphasized  using underlining.   See 
Section 2.2 in NIST SP 800-172 for the discussion on assignments and selections. 
• Assessment  Objectives  [N
IST  SP  800-172A]: Identifies  the  specific  list  of  objectives  
that must be met to receive MET for the requirement as defined in NIST SP 800-172A and 
includes the Level 3 assignment/selection text (as appropriate). In cases where a Level 3 
assignment fully   satisfies   the   definition(s)   required   in   an organization-defined 
parameter (ODP)   in NIST SP 800-172A, the ODP statement is not included as an objective, 
since   that   objective   has   been   met   by   the   assignment   itself. However,   when   the   
assignment does not fully contain all required aspects of a NIST SP 800-172A ODP, the 
ODP is included as its own objective, using the original NIST SP 800-172A ODP number 
(e.g., “[ODP4]”). See the breakout box ORGANIZATION-DEFINED PARAMETERS in Section 
2.1  of  NIST  SP  800-172A  for  additional  details  on  an ODP.  In  all  cases  where  an  
assignment is used within an objective, it also emphasized using underlining. 
• Potential Assessment Methods and Objects [NIST SP 800-172A]: Defines the nature 
and  extent  of  the  assessor’s actions.  Potential  assessment  methods  and  objects  are  as  
defined   in   NIST SP   800-172A.   The   methods   include   examine, interview,   and   test. 
Assessment  objects  identify  the  items  being  assessed  and  can  include  specifications,  
mechanisms, activities, and individuals. 
• Discussion [NIST SP 800-172]: Contains discussion from the associated NIST SP 800-172 
security requirement. 
• Further Discussion:  
• Expands  upon  the  NIST  content  to  provide  supplemental  information  on  the  
requirement intent. 
• Contains examples illustrating how the OSC might apply the requirement. These 
examples  provide  insight  but  are  not  intended  to  be  prescriptive  of  how  the  
requirement   must   be   implemented,   nor   comprehensive   of   all   assessment   
objectives necessary to achieve the requirement. The assessment objectives met 
within the example are referenced by letter in brackets (e.g., [a,d] for objectives 
“a”  and  “d”)  within  the  text.  Note  that  some  of  the  examples  contain  company  
names; all company names used in this document are fictitious.

Access Control (AC) 
AC.L3-3.1.2E – ORGANIZATIONALLY CONTROLLED ASSETS 
Restrict access to systems and system components to only those information resources that 
are owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-172A] 
Determine if: 
[a] Information  resources  that  are  owned,  provisioned,  or  issued  by  the  organization  are  
identified; and 
[b] Access  to  systems  and  system  components  is  restricted  to  only  those  information  
resources that are owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-172A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of external systems; 
list  of  information  resources  owned,  provisioned,  or  issued  by  the  organization;  security  
plan;   system   design   documentation;   system   configuration   settings   and   associated   
documentation; system connection or processing agreements; system audit records; account 
management documents; other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for restricting or prohibiting the use 
of   non-organizationally   owned   systems,   system   components,   or   devices;   system   and   
network administrators; organizational personnel responsible for system security]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing restrictions on the use of non-organizationally 
owned systems, components, or devices]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
Information resources that are not owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization include 
systems  or  system  components  owned  by  other  organizations  and  personally  owned  
devices.   Non-organizational   information   resources   present   significant   risks   to   the   
organization   and   complicate   the   ability   to   employ   a   “comply-to-connect”   policy   or   
implement  component  or  device  attestation  techniques  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  
organizational system.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13

FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Implementing this requirement ensures that an organization has control over the systems 
that can connect to organizational assets. This control will allow more effective and efficient 
application of security policy. The terms “has control over” provides policy for systems that 
are  not  owned  outright  by  the  organization. Control  includes  policies,  regulations  or  
standards that are enforced on the resource accessing contractor systems. Control may also 
be exercised through contracts or agreements with the external party. Provisioned includes 
setting configuration, whether through direct technical means or by policy or agreement. For 
purposes of this requirement, GFE can be considered provisioned by the OSA. 
Example 1 
You  are  the  chief  network  architect  for  your  company.  Company  policy  states  that  all  
company-owned  assets  must  be  separated  from  all  non-company-owned (i.e.,  guest  or  
employee) assets. You  decide  the  best  way  forward  is  to  modify  the  corporate  wired  and  
wireless  networks  to  only  allow  company-owned  devices  to  connect  [b]. All  other  devices  
are connected to a second (untrusted) network that non-corporate devices may use to access 
the  internet.  The  two  environments  are  physically  separated  and  are  not  allowed  to  be  
connected.  You  also  decide  to  limit  the  virtual  private  network  (VPN)    services  of  the  
company to devices owned by the corporation by installing certificate keys and have the VPN 
validate the configuration of connecting devices before they are allowed in [b]. 
Example 2 
You are a small company that uses an External Service Provider (ESP) to provide your audit 
logging.  Access  between  the  ESP  and  the  organization  is  controlled  by  the  agreement  
between the organization and the ESP. That agreement will include the policies, standards, 
and configuration for the required access. Technical controls should be documented and in 
place which limit the ESP’s access to the minimum required to perform the logging service. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Can   the   organization   demonstrate   a   non-company-owned   device   failing   to   access   
information resources owned by the company [b]? 
• How is this requirement met for organizational devices that are specialized assets (GFE, 
restricted information systems) [a,b]? 
• Does  the  company  allow  employees  to  charge  personal  cell  phones  on  organizational  
systems [b]?

AC.L3-3.1.3E – SECURED INFORMATION TRANSFER 
Employ secure information transfer solutions to control information flows between security 
domains on connected systems. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-172A] 
Determine if: 
[ODP1] Secure information transfer solutions are defined; 
[a] Information flows between security domains on connected systems are identified; and 
[b] Secure   information   transfer   solutions   are   employed   to   control   information   flows   
between security domains on connected systems. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-172A] 
Examine 
[SELECT   FROM:   Access   control   policy;   information   flow   control   policies;   procedures   
addressing  information  flow  enforcement;  system  design  documentation;  security  plan;  
system configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system 
baseline configuration; list of information flow authorizations; other relevant documents or 
records].

for information security; system developers]. 
Test 
[SELECT    FROM:    Mechanisms    implementing    information    flow    enforcement    policy;    
mechanisms implementing secure information transfer solutions]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP
 800-172] 
Organizations  employ  information  flow  control  policies  and  enforcement  mechanisms  to  
control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems 
and  between  connected  systems.  Flow  control  is  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  
information  and/or  the  information  path.  Enforcement  occurs,  for  example,  in  boundary  
protection  devices  that  employ  rule  sets  or  establish  configuration  settings  that  restrict  
system  services,  provide  a  packet-filtering  capability  based  on  header  information,  or  
provide   a   message-filtering   capability   based   on   message   content.   Organizations   also   
consider   the   trustworthiness   of   filtering   and   inspection   mechanisms   (i.e.,   hardware,   
firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. 
Transferring  information  between  systems  in  different  security  domains  with  different  
security policies introduces the risk that the transfers violate one or more domain security 

 
AC.L3-3.1.3e –   Secured Information Transfer

18 
 
policies. In such situations, information owners or information stewards provide guidance 
at   designated   policy   enforcement   points   between   connected   systems.   Organizations   
mandate  specific  architectural  solutions  when  required  to  enforce  logical  or  physical  
separation between systems in different security domains. Enforcement includes prohibiting 
information  transfers  between  connected  systems,  employing  hardware  mechanisms  to  
enforce    one-way    information    flows,    verifying    write    permissions    before    accepting    
information   from   another   security   domain   or   connected   system,   and   implementing   
trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and labels. 
Secure information transfer solutions often include one or more of the following properties: 
use of cross-domain solutions when traversing security domains, mutual authentication of 
the sender and recipient (using hardware-based cryptography), encryption of data in transit 
and at rest, isolation from other domains, and logging of information transfers (e.g., title of 
file, file size, cryptographic hash of file, sender, recipient, transfer time and Internet Protocol 
[IP] address, receipt time, and IP address). 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The  organization  implementing  this  requirement  must  decide  on  the  secure  information  
transfer solutions they will use. The solutions must be configured to have strong protection 
mechanisms  for  information  flow  between  security  domains.  Secure  information  transfer  
solutions control information flow between a Level 3 enclave and other CMMC or non-CMMC 
enclaves. If    CUI requiring Level 3 protection resides in one area of the environment or within 
a   given   enclave   outside   of   the   normal   working   environment,   protection   to   prevent   
unauthorized   personnel   from   accessing,   disseminating, and   sharing   the   protected   
information is required. Physical and virtual methods can be employed to implement secure 
information transfer solutions. 
Example 
You are the administrator for an enterprise that stores and processes CUI requiring Level 3 
protection. The files containing CUI information are tagged by the company as CUI. To ensure 
secure information transfer, you use an intermediary device to check the transfer of any CUI 
files. The device sits at the boundary of the CUI enclave, is aware of all other CUI domains in 
the  enterprise,  and  has  the  ability  to  examine  the  metadata  in  the  encrypted  payload.  The  
tool checks all outbound communications paths. It first checks the metadata for all data being 
transferred.  If  that  data  is  identified  as CUI,  the  device  checks  the  destination  to  see  if  the  
transfer is to another, sufficiently certified CUI domain. If the destination is not a sufficient 
CUI domain, the tool blocks the communication path and does not allow the transfer to take 
place. If the destination is a sufficient CUI domain, the transfer is allowed. The intermediary 
device logs all blocks. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Has the organization defined the secure information transfer solutions it is using [b]? 
• Has  the  organization  defined  domains,  boundaries,  and  flows  between  those  domains  
that need to be controlled [a]?

• Has  the  organization  defined  attributes  to  be  associated  with  the CUI,  and  both  source 
and destination objects [b]? 
• Has the organization defined metadata or some other tagging mechanism to be used as a 
means of enforcing CUI flow control [b]? 
• Has  the  organization  defined  filters  to  be  used  as  a  basis  for  enforcing  flow  control  
decisions [b]? 
• Has  the  organization  identified  CUI  flows  for  which  flow  control  decisions  are  to  be  
applied and enforced [a,b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
An effective method to detect APT activities and reduce the effectiveness of those activities 
is to provide specific awareness training for individuals. A well-trained and security-aware 
workforce  provides  another  organizational  safeguard  that  can  be  employed  as  part  of  a  
defense-in-depth  strategy  to  protect  organizations  against  malicious  code  injections  via  
email or web applications. Threat awareness training includes educating individuals on the 
various  ways  that  APTs  can  infiltrate  organizations,  including  through  websites,  emails,  
advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social engineering. Training can include techniques for 
recognizing suspicious emails, the use of removable systems in non-secure settings, and the 
potential targeting of individuals by adversaries outside the workplace. Awareness training 
is  assessed  and  updated  periodically  to  ensure  that  the  training  is  relevant  and  effective,  
particularly with respect to the threat since it is constantly, and often rapidly, evolving. 
[NIST SP 800-50] provides guidance on security awareness and training programs. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
All  organizations,  regardless  of  size, should  have  a  cyber  training  program  that  helps  
employees  understand  threats  they  will  face  on  a  daily basis. This  training  must  include  
knowledge about APT actors, breaches, and suspicious behaviors. 
Example 
You are the cyber training coordinator for a small business with eight employees. You do not 
have your own in-house cyber training program. Instead, you use a third-party company to 
provide  cyber  training.  New  hires  take  the  course  when  they  start, and  all  current  staff  
members receive refresher training at least once a year [b]. When significant changes to the 
threat landscape take place, the company contacts you and informs you that an update to the 
training has been completed [c,d] and everyone will need to receive training [b]. You keep a 
log  of  all  employees  who  have  gone  through  the  cyber  training  program  and  the  dates  of 
training. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Does  the  organization  have  evidence  that  employees  participate  in  cyber  awareness 
training at initial hire and at least annually thereafter or when there have been significant 
changes to the threat [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
Awareness training is most effective when it is complemented by practical exercises tailored 
to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the threat. Examples of practical exercises 
include  unannounced  social  engineering  attempts  to  gain  unauthorized  access,  collect  
information,  or  simulate  the  adverse  impact  of  opening  malicious  email  attachments  or  
invoking,  via  spear  phishing  attacks,  malicious  web  links.  Rapid  feedback  is  essential  to  
reinforce desired user behavior. Training results, especially failures of personnel in critical 
roles,  can  be  indicative  of  a  potentially  serious  problem.  It  is  important  that  senior  
management   are   made   aware   of   such   situations   so   that   they   can   take   appropriate   
remediating actions.  
[NIST SP 800-181] provides guidance on role-based security training, including a lexicon and 
taxonomy that describes cybersecurity work via work roles. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
This  requirement can  be  performed  by  the  organization  or  by  a  third-party  company. 
Training exercises (including unannounced exercises, such as phishing training) should be 
performed  at  various  times  throughout  the  year  to  encourage  employee  readiness.  After 
each exercise session has been completed, the results should be recorded (date, time, what 
and who the training tested, and the percent of successful and unsuccessful responses). The 
purpose of training is to help employees in all roles act appropriately for any given training 
situation,   which   should   reflect   real-life   scenarios.   Collected   results   will   help   identify   
shortcomings in the cyber training and/or whether additional instructional training may be 
needed. 
General exercises can be included for all users, but exercises tailored for specific roles are 
important, too. Training tailored for specific roles helps make sure individuals are ready for 
actions and events specific to their positions in a company. Privileged users receive training 
that emphasizes what permissions their privileged account has in a given environment and 
what extra care is required when using their privileged account. 
Example 
You  are  the  cyber  training  coordinator  for  a  medium-sized  business. You  and  a  coworker 
have  developed  a specialized  awareness  training  to  increase  cybersecurity  awareness  
around your organization. Your training includes social media campaigns, social engineering 
phone  calls,  and  phishing  emails  with  disguised links  to  staff  to  train  them  beyond  the  
standard cybersecurity training [a,b]. 
To  send  simulated phishing  emails  to  staff,  you  subscribe  to  a third-party  service  that 
specializes in this area [a]. The service sets up fictitious websites with disguised links to help 
train  general staff  against  this  TTP  used  by  APTs  [d]. The  third-party  company  tracks  the  
individuals who were sent phishing emails and whether they click on any of the of the links 
within the emails. After the training action is completed, you receive a report from the third-
party company. The results show that 20% of the staff clicked on one or more phishing email 
links, demonstrating a significant risk to your company. As the cyber training coordinator,

you notify the individuals, informing them they failed the training and identifying the area(s) 
of   concern   [e]. You   send   an   email   to   the supervisors   informing   them   who   in   their   
organization has  received  training.  You  also  send  an  email  out  to  the  entire  company  
explaining the training that just took place and the overall results [e]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are the individuals being trained and the results recorded [e]? 
• Are the training exercises performed [c]? 
• Are the exercises set up for all users? Are there tailored exercises based on roles within 
the organization (general users, users with specialized roles, and privileged users) [d]? 
• Does   the   organization   have   documentation   recording   the   training   exercises,   who   
participated, and feedback provided to those who participated in a training session [c,e]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
The  establishment  and  maintenance  of  an  authoritative  source  and  repository  includes  a  
system  component  inventory  of  approved  hardware,  software,  and  firmware;  approved 
system baseline configurations and configuration changes; and verified system software and 
firmware,  as  well  as  images  and/or  scripts.  The  authoritative  source  implements  integrity  
controls  to  log  changes  or  attempts  to  change  software,  configurations,  or  data  in  the  
repository.  Additionally,  changes  to  the  repository  are  subject  to  change  management  
procedures  and  require  authentication  of  the  user  requesting  the  change.  In  certain  
situations,  organizations  may  also  require  dual  authorization  for  such  changes.  Software  
changes are routinely checked for integrity and authenticity to ensure that the changes are 
legitimate  when  updating  the  repository  and  when  refreshing  a  system  from  the  known,  
trusted  source.  The  information  in  the  repository  is  used  to  demonstrate  adherence  to  or  
identify  deviation  from  the  established  configuration  baselines  and  to  restore  system  
components from a trusted source. From an automated assessment perspective, the system 
description  provided  by  the  authoritative  source  is  referred  to  as  the  desired  state.  The  
desired state is compared to the actual state to check for compliance or deviations. [NIST SP 
800-128]  provides  guidance  on  security  configuration  management,  including  security  
configuration settings and configuration change control. 
[NIST  IR  8011-1]  provides  guidance  on  automation  support  to  assess  system  and  system  
component configurations. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Trusted software, whether securely developed in house or obtained from a trusted source, 
should  have  baseline data  integrity  established  when  first  created  or  obtained,  such  as  by  
using hash algorithms to obtain a hash value that would be used to validate the source prior 
to use of the software in a given system. Hardware in the repository should be stored in boxes 
or containers with tamper-evident seals. Hashes and seals should be checked on a regular 
basis employing the principle of separation of duties. 
Example 
You are the primary system build technician at a medium-sized company. You have been put 
in charge of creating, documenting, and implementing a baseline configuration for all user 
systems [c]. You have identified a minimum set of software that is needed by all employees 
to complete their work (e.g., office automation software). You acquire trusted versions of the 
software and build one or more baselines of all system software, firmware, and applications 
required  by  the  organization.  The  gold  version  of  each  baseline  is  stored  in  a  secure  
configuration management system repository and updated as required to maintain integrity 
and security. Access to the build repository for updates and use is carefully controlled using 
access control mechanisms that limit access to you and your staff. All interactions with the 
repository are logged. Using an automated build tool, your team builds each organizational 
system using the standard baseline

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
System  components  used  to  process,  store,  transmit,  or  protect  CUI  are  monitored  and  
checked   against   the   authoritative   source   (i.e.,   hardware   and   software   inventory   and   
associated baseline configurations). From an automated assessment perspective, the system 
description  provided  by  the  authoritative  source  is  referred  to  as  the  desired  state.  Using 
automated tools, the desired state is compared to the actual state to check for compliance or 
deviations. Security responses to system components that are unknown or that deviate from 
approved configurations can include removing the components; halting system functions or 
processing;  placing  the  system  components  in  a  quarantine  or  remediation  network  that  
facilitates   patching,   re-configuration,   or   other   mitigations;   or   issuing   alerts   and/or   
notifications  to  personnel  when  there  is  an  unauthorized  modification  of  an  organization-
defined   configuration   item.   Responses   can   be   automated,   manual,   or   procedural.   
Components  that  are  removed  from  the  system  are  rebuilt  from  the  trusted  configuration 
baseline established by the authoritative source. 
[NIST IR   8011-1]   provides   guidance   on   using   automation   support   to   assess   system   
configurations 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
For  this  requirement,  the  organization  is  required  to  implement  automated  tools  to  help  
identify  misconfigured  components.  Once  under  an  attacker’s  control,  the  system  may  be  
modified in some manner and the automated tool should detect this. Or, if a user performs a 
manual  configuration  adjustment,  the  system  will  be  viewed  as  misconfigured,  and  that  
change should be detected. Another common example is if a component has been offline and 
not  updated,  the  tool  should  detect  the  incorrect  configuration.  If  any  of  these  scenarios  
occurs, the automated configuration management system (ACMS) will notice a change and 
can take the system offline, quarantine the system, or send an alert so the component(s) can 
be  manually  removed.  Quarantining  a  misconfigured  component  does  not  require  it  to  be  
removed from the network. Quarantining only requires that a temporary limitation be put 
in  place  eliminating  the  component’s  ability  to  process,  store,  or  transmit  CUI  until  it  is  
properly configured. If a component has the potential of disrupting business operations then 
the OSC should take extra care to ensure configuration updates are properly tested and that 
components  are  properly  configured  and  tested  before  being  added  to  the  network.  Once 
one of these actions is accomplished, a system technician may need to manually inspect the 
system or rebuild it using the baseline configuration. Another option is for an ACMS to make 
adjustments  while  the  system  is  running  rather  than  performing  an  entire  rebuild.  These  
adjustments can include replacing configuration files, executable files, scripts, or library files 
on the fly. 
Example 1 
As  the  system  administrator,  you  implement  company  policy  stating  that  every  system  
connecting  to  the  company  network  via  VPN  will  be  checked  for  specific  configuration  
settings and software versioning before it is allowed to connect to the network, after it passes 
authentication  [a,b]. If  any  deviations  from  the  authoritative  baseline are  identified,  the  

 
CM.L3-3.4.2e –   Automated Detection & Remediation

system is placed in a VPN quarantine zone (remediation network)   using a virtual local area 
network (VLAN) [b,c,d]. This VLAN is set up for system analysis, configuration changes, and 
rebuilding after forensic information is pulled from the system. Once the system updates are 
complete, the system will be removed from the quarantine zone and placed on the network 
through the VPN connection. 
Example 2 
As the system administrator, you have chosen to use a network access control (NAC) solution 
to  validate  system  configurations  before  they  are  allowed  to  connect  to  the  corporate  
network [a]. When a system plugs into or connects to a local network port or the VPN, the 
NAC solution checks the hash of installed system software [b,c]. If the system does not pass 
the configuration check, it is put in quarantine until an administrator can examine it or the 
ACMS updates the system to pass the system checks [d]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Can  the  organization  explain  the  automated  process that identifies,  quarantines,  and  
remediates  a  system  when  a  misconfiguration  or  unauthorized  system  component  is  
identified [a,b,c,d]? 
• Does the organization have a patching and rebuild process for all   assets that may be taken 
offline [d]?

information,  software  version  numbers,  and— for  networked  components—the  machine  
names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include the manufacturer, supplier 
information,  component  type,  date  of  receipt,  cost,  model,  serial  number,  and  physical 
location.   Organizations   also   use   automated   mechanisms   to   implement   and   maintain   
authoritative (i.e., up-to-date, complete, accurate, and available) baseline configurations for 
systems  that  include  hardware  and  software  inventory  tools,  configuration  management  
tools,  and  network  management  tools.  Tools  can  be  used  to  track  version  numbers  on  
operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and current patch levels. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Organizations use  an automated capability  to  discover  components  connected  to  the  
network  and system  software installed.  The automated  capability  must  also  be  able  to  
identify  attributes  associated  with  those  components.  For  systems  that  have  already  been  
coupled  to  the  environment,  they  should  allow  remote  access  for inspection  of  the  system  
software configuration and components. Another option is to place an agent on systems that 
performs internal system checks to identify system software   configuration and components. 
Collection of switch and router data can also be used to identify systems on networks. 
Example 
Within your organization, you are in charge of implementing an authoritative inventory of 
system  components.  You  first  create  a  list  of  the  automated technologies  you  will  use  and  
what  each  technology  will  be  responsible  for  identifying  [a]. This  includes  gathering 
information  from  switches,  routers,  access  points,  primary  domain  controllers,  and  all  
connected systems or devices, whether wired or wireless (printers, IoT, IIoT, OT, IT, etc.) [b]. 
To  keep  the  data  up-to-date, you  set  a  very  short  search frequency  for  identifying  new  
components. To maximize availability of this data, all information will be placed in a central 
inventory/configuration management system, and automated reporting is performed every 
day [c]. A user dashboard is set up that allows you and other administrators to run reports 
at any time. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Can  the  organization  explain  the  process  by  which  current  inventory information  is  
acquired [a]? 
• Is the organization able to produce an inventory of components on the network [b,c]? 
• Has  the  organization  implemented  a  valid  frequency for  the  component  discovery 
solution [b,c]? 
• Can the organization demonstrate that the inventory is current and accurate [b]? 
• Has   the   organization   developed   a   defined   list   of   identifiable   attributes   for   each   
component type, and is that list adequate to support component accountability [a]? 
• Is the organization able to track, monitor, and verify configuration items in accordance 
with the organization’s authoritative list of components [b,c]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
Cryptographically-based and replay-resistant authentication between systems, components, 
and  devices  addresses  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  from  spoofing  (i.e.,  claiming  a  false  
identity).    The    requirement    applies    to    client-server    authentication,    server-server 
authentication, and device authentication (including mobile devices). The cryptographic key 
for   authentication   transactions   is   stored   in   suitably   secure   storage   available   to   the   
authenticator  application  (e.g.,  keychain  storage,  Trusted  Platform  Module  [TPM],  Trusted  
Execution Environment [TEE], or secure element). Mandating authentication requirements 
at every connection point may not be practical, and therefore, such requirements may only 
be applied periodically or at the initial point of network connection. 
[NIST SP 800-63-3] provides guidance on identity and authenticator management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The  intent  of  this  practice  is  to  prevent  unauthorized  devices  from  connecting  to  one  
another. One example satisfying this requirement is a web server configured with transport 
layer security (TLS) using mutual  authentication.  At  a  lower  level  in  the  OSI  stack,  IPsec  
provides   application-transparent   mutual   authentication.   Another   example   would   be   
implementing 802.1X technology to enforce port-based NAC. This is done by enabling 802.1X 
on switches, wireless access points, and VPN connections for a given network. 802.1X defines 
authentication   controls   for   devices   trying   to   access   a   given   network.   NAC   controls 
authorization   and   policy   management.   For   this   to   be   implemented,   bidirectional   
authentication  must  be  turned  on  via  802.1X.  Once  successfully  authenticated,  the  device  
may communicate on the network. A final example, at the application-server level, involves 
the use of Kerberos to control 1) which files a client can access and 2) the transmission of 
sensitive data from the client to the server. 
Example 1 
You are the network engineer in charge of implementing this requirement. You have been 
instructed  to  implement  a  technology  that  will  provide  mutual  authentication  for  client  
server connections. You implement Kerberos. 
On the server side, client authentication is implemented by having the client establish a local 
security context. This is initially accomplished by having the client present credentials which 
are  confirmed  by  the  Active  Directory  Domain  Controller  (DC).  After  that,  the  client  may  
establish context via a session of a logged-in user. The service does not accept connections 
from any unauthenticated client. 
On   the   client   side,   server   authentication   requires   registration,   using   administrator   
privileges, of unique Service Provider Names (SPNs) for each service instance offered. The 
names  are  registered  in  the  Active  Directory  Domain  Controller.  When  a  client  requests  a  
connection to a service, it composes an SPN for a service instance, using known data or data 
provided by the user. For authentication, the client presents its SPN to the Key Distribution 
Center (KDC), and the KDC searches for computers with the registered SPN before allowing 
a connection via an encrypted message passed to the client for forwarding to the server. 

 
IA.L3-3.5.1e –   Bidirectional Authentication 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13

Example 2 
You are the network engineer in charge of implementing this requirement. You have been 
instructed to implement a technology that will provide authentication for each system prior 
to connecting to the environment. You implement the company-approved scheme that uses 
cryptographic keys installed on each system for it to authenticate to the environment, as well 
as user-based cryptographic keys that are used in combination with a user’s password for 
user-level  authentication  [a,c]. Your  authentication  implementation  is  finalized  on  each  
system using an ACM solution. When a system connects to the network, the system uses the 
system-level certificate to authenticate itself to the switch before the switch will allow it to 
access  the  corporate  network  [a,c].  This  is  accomplished  using  802.1x  technology  on  the  
switch and by authenticating with a RADIUS server that authenticates itself with the system 
via cryptographic keys. If either system fails to authenticate to the other, the trust is broken, 
and the system will not be able to connect to or communicate on the network. You also set 
up a similar implementation in your wireless access point.  
Example 3 
You  are  the  network  engineer  in  charge  of  implementing  the  VPN  solution  used  by  the  
organization.  To  meet  this  requirement, you use a  VPN  gateway  server  and  public  key  
infrastructure (PKI) certificates via a certification authority (CA) and a chain of trust. When 
a  client  starts  a  VPN  connection,  the  server  presents  its  certificate  to  the  client  and  if  the  
certificate is  trusted,  the  client  then  presents  its  certificate  to  the  server  [a]. If  the  server  
validates  the  client  certificate, an  established  communications  channel  is  opened  for  the  
client  to  finish  the  authentication  process  and  gain  access  to  the  network  via  the  VPN  
gateway server [c]. If the client fails final authentication, fails the certification validation, or 
the VPN gateway fails the certificate check by the client, the communication channel will be 
denied. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Are cryptographic keys stored securely [a]? 
• Has the requirement been implemented for any of the three use cases, where applicable: 
client-server  authentication,  server-server  authentication,  and  device  authentication 
[b,c]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
Identification and authentication of system components and component configurations can 
be determined, for example, via a cryptographic hash of the component. This is also known 
as  device  attestation  and  known  operating  state  or  trust  profile.  A  trust  profile  based  on  
factors such as the user, authentication method, device type, and physical location is used to 
make dynamic decisions on authorizations to data of varying types. If device attestation is 
the means of identification and authentication, then it is important that patches and updates 
to the device are handled via a configuration management process such that the patches and 
updates are done securely and do not disrupt the identification and authentication of other 
devices. 
[NIST IR   8011-1]   provides   guidance   on   using   automation   support   to   assess   system   
configurations. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
This  requirement can  be  achieved  in several ways,  such  as  blocking  based  on  posture 
assessments, conditional access, or trust profiles. A posture assessment can be used to assess 
a given system’s posture to validate that it meets the standards set by the organization before 
allowing it to connect. Conditional access is the set of policies and configurations that control 
devices receiving access to services and data sources. Conditional access helps an organization 
build rules that manage security controls,  perform blocking,  and restrict components. A trust 
profile is a set of factors that are checked to inform a device that a system can be trusted. 
Example 1 
In  a  Windows  environment, you  authorize  devices  to  connect  to  systems  by  defining 
configuration rules  in  one  or  more  Group  Policy  Objects  (GPO)  that  can  be  automatically  
applied to all relevant devices in a domain [a]. This provides you with a mechanism to apply 
rules for which devices are authorized to connect to any given system and prevent devices 
that are not within the defined list from connecting [b,c]. For instance, universal serial bus 
(USB) device rules for authorization can be defined by using a USB device’s serial number, 
model number, and manufacturer information. This information can be used to build a trust 
profile for a device and authorize it for  use by a given system. You use security policies to 
prevent unauthorized components from connecting to systems [c].

Example 2 
You have  been  assigned  to  build  trust  profiles  for  all  devices  allowed  to  connect  to  your  
organization’s systems. You want to test the capability starting with printers. You talk to your 
purchasing  department,  and  they  tell  you  that  policy  states  every  printer  must  be  from  a  
specific manufacturer; they only purchase four different models. They also collect all serial 
numbers from purchased printers. You gather this information and build trust profiles for 
each device [a,b]. Because your organization shares printers, you push the trust profiles out 
to organizational systems. Now, the systems are not allowed to connect to a network printer 
unless they are within the trust profiles you have provided [b,c]. 
Example 3 
Your organization has implemented a network access control solution (NAC) to help ensure 
that only properly configured computers are allowed to connect to the corporate network 
[a,b]. The solution first checks for the presence of a certificate to indicate that the device is 
company-  owned. It next reviews the patch state of the computer and forces the installation 
of  any  patches  that  are  required  by  the  organization.  Finally,  it  reviews  the  computer’s  
configuration to ensure that the firewall is active and that the appropriate security policies 
have  been  applied.  Once  the  computer  has  passed  all  of  these  requirements,  it  is  allowed  
access to network resources and defined as a trusted asset for the length of its session [a]. 
Devices that do not meet all of the requirements are automatically blocked from connecting 
to the network [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• If the organization is using a manual method, is the method outlined in detail so any user 
will be able to follow it without making an error [b,c]? 
• If the organization is using an automated method, can the organization explain how the 
technology performs the task? Can they explain the steps needed to implement [a,b,c]? 
• Can the  organization  provide  evidence  showing  they  have  trust  profiles  for  specific  
devices [a,b,c]? 
• Can  the  organization explain  how  their  system  components  authenticate  to  a  system  if  
they are not using trust profiles [b,c]?

DISCUSSION [NIST S
P 800-172] 
A security operations center (SOC) is the focal point for security operations and computer 
network  defense  for  an  organization.  The  purpose  of  the  SOC  is  to  defend  and  monitor  an  
organization’s systems and networks (i.e., cyber infrastructure) on an ongoing basis. The SOC 
is also responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents in a 
timely  manner.  The  SOC  is  staffed  with  skilled  technical  and  operational  personnel  (e.g.,  
security   analysts,   incident   response   personnel,   systems   security   engineers);   in   some   
instances  operates  24  hours  per  day,  seven  days  per  week;  and  implements  technical,  
management,  and  operational  controls  (e.g.,  monitoring,  scanning,  and  forensics  tools)  to

monitor, fuse, correlate, analyze, and respond to security-relevant event data from multiple 
sources. Sources of event data include perimeter defenses, network devices (e.g., gateways, 
routers, and switches), and endpoint agent data feeds. The SOC provides a holistic situational 
awareness capability to help organizations determine the security posture of the system and 
organization.  An  SOC  capability  can  be  obtained  in  many  ways.  Larger  organizations  may  
implement   a   dedicated   SOC   while   smaller   organizations   may   employ   third-party 
organizations to provide such a capability. 
[NIST  SP  800-61]  provides  guidance  on  incident  handling.  [NIST  SP  800-86]  and  [NIST  SP 
800-101] provide guidance on integrating forensic techniques into incident response. [NIST 
SP  800-150]  provides  guidance  on  cyber  threat  information  sharing.  [NIST  SP  800-184] 
provides guidance on cybersecurity event recovery. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Security  operations centers  are  created  to  monitor  and  respond  to  suspicious  activities  
across an organization’s IT applications and infrastructure. A SOC may be implemented in a 
variety of physical, virtual, and geographic constructs. The organization may also opt to not 
hire their  own  staff  but  to engage  a  third-party external service  provider  to  serve  as  their  
SOC. 
The  SOC  is  typically  comprised  of  multiple  levels  of  cybersecurity  analysts.  Each  tier  of  
cybersecurity analysts works on increasingly complex aspects of Incident Response. The SOC 
may also have dedicated cybersecurity engineers to support configuration and management 
of defensive cyber tools. The SOC may work with staff in IT operations who provide support 
to the SOC. 
SOC capabilities run 24/7, and while staff may not always be performing tasks for the SOC, 
the capability alerts staff members and directs them to go to a facility or perform SOC actions 
from  a  remote  location. Staff  members  should  be  scheduled  or  on call to  ensure  they are 
available when needed. 
Example 
You are  the Chief  Information  Security  Officer  ( CISO)   of  a  medium-sized  organization.  To 
meet the  goal  of  24/7  SOC  operation,  you  have  decided  to  adjust  the  current SOC,  which 
operates five days a week for 12 hours a day, by minimizing active staff members and hiring 
trusted expert consultants to have on call at all times (i.e., seven days a week, 24 hours a day) 
[a,b]. You design your  SOC  to  be  remotely  accessible  so  your  experts  can  access  your  
environment when needed. You also decide to set up a very strong automated capability that 
is good at identifying questionable activities and alerting the appropriate staff. You create a 
policy  stating  that  after  an  alert  goes  out,  two  members  of  the  SOC  team  must remotely 
connect  to  the  environment  within  15  minutes  to  address  the  problem.  All  staff  members  
also  have  regular  working  hours  during  which  they  perform  other  SOC  activities,  such  as  
updating information to help the automated tool perform its functions [c].

DISCUSSION [NIST S
P 800-172] 
A  cyber  incident  response  team  (CIRT)  is  a  team  of  experts  that  assesses,  documents,  and  
responds  to  cyber  incidents  so  that  organizational  systems  can  recover  quickly  and  
implement  the  necessary  controls  to  avoid  future  incidents.  CIRT  personnel  include,  for  
example,  forensic  analysts,  malicious  code  analysts,  systems  security  engineers,  and  real-
time  operations  personnel.  The  incident  handling  capability  includes  performing  rapid  
forensic  preservation  of  evidence  and  analysis  of  and  response  to  intrusions.  The  team  
members may or may not be full-time but need to be available to respond in the time period 
required. The size and specialties of the team are based on known and anticipated threats. 
The  team  is  typically  pre-equipped  with  the  software  and  hardware  (e.g.,  forensic  tools)  
necessary for rapid identification, quarantine, mitigation, and recovery and is familiar with 
how   to   preserve   evidence   and   maintain   chain   of   custody   for   law   enforcement   or   
counterintelligence  uses.  For  some  organizations,  the  CIRT  can  be  implemented  as  a  cross  
organizational entity or as part of the Security Operations Center (SOC).

SP  800-150]  provides  guidance  on  cyber  threat  information  sharing.  [NIST  SP  800-184] 
provides guidance on cybersecurity event recovery. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The  CIRT’s  primary  function  is  to  handle  information  security  incident  management  and  
response for the environments the SOC oversees. The primary goals of the CIRT are triage 
and  initial  response  to  an  incident.  They  also  communicate    with  all  the  proper  people  to 
ensure  understanding  of  an  incident  and  the  response  actions,  including  collection  of  
forensic evidence, have been conveyed. 
If and when an incident is detected by the organization’s SOC, the IR team is responsible for 
handling  the  incident  and  communicating  what  has  happened  to  the  appropriate  people  
within the organization, as well to the authorities (as needed). 
The  deployment  of  a  team  does  not  necessarily  mean  they  are  “physically  deployed.” 
Deployment may simply mean connecting to a remote system in a manner that is equivalent 
to being on the system’s keyboard. Remote access can provide just as much capability as local 
access in many cases. 
Some  situations  require  physical  access.  For  instance,  if  the  company  has  a  physically 
isolated environment located at a remote location, a team must be physically present at the 
remote facility to perform the duties required. 
Example 
You are the lead for an IR team within your organization. Your manager is the SOC lead, and 
she reports  to  the  chief  information  officer  (CIO). As  the  SOC  is  alerted  and/or  identifies  
incidents within the organization’s environments, you lead and deploy teams to resolve the 
issues, including incidents involving cloud-based systems. You use a custom dashboard that 
was  created  for  your  team  members  to  view  and  manage incidents,  perform  response  
actions, and record actions and notes for each case. You also have your team create an after 
action report for all incidents to which they respond;  this information is used to determine 
if a given incident requires additional action and reporting [a]. 
One  day, you  receive  a  message  from  the  SOC  that  your  website  has  become  corrupted. 
Within minutes,  you  have  a  team  on  the  system  inspecting  logs,  analyzing  applications,  
preserving  key  information,  and  looking  for  evidence  of  tampering/attack  [b]. Your  team  
runs  through  a  procedure  set  for  this  specific  incident  type based  on  a  handbook  the  
organization  has  created  and  maintains  [c].  It  is  found  that  a  cyberattack  caused  the  
corruption, but the corruption caused a crash, which prevented the attack from continuing. 
Your team takes note of all actions they perform, and at the end of the incident analysis, you 
send  a  message  to  the  website  lead  to  inform  them  of  the  issue,  case  number,  and  notes  
created by the team. The website lead has their team rebuild the system and validate that 
the attack no longer works. At the end of the incident, the CISO and CIO are informed of the 
issue.

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
If adverse information develops or is obtained about an individual with access to CUI which 
calls   into   question   whether   the   individual   should   have   continued   access   to   systems   
containing  CUI,  actions  are  taken  (e.g.,  preclude  or  limit  further  access  by  the  individual,  
audit  actions  taken  by  the  individual)  to  protect  the  CUI  while  the  adverse  information  is  
resolved. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
According to Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, or DCSA (Industrial Security 
Letter ISL 2011-04, revised July 15, 2020), adverse information consists of any information 
that  negatively  reflects  the  integrity  or  character  of  an individual.  This  pertains  to  an 
individual’s ability to safeguard sensitive information, such as CUI. Adverse information may 
simply be a report showing someone has sent sensitive information outside the organization 
or used unapproved software, against c ompany policy. An organization may receive adverse 
information  about  an  individual  through police  reports,  reported  violations of  company  
policies (including social media posts that directly violate company policies),   and revocation 
or suspension of DoD clearance. 
When  adverse  information  is  identified  about  a  given  individual,  the  organization  should  
take  action  to  validate  that information  resources  accessible  by  the  individual  have  been  
identified and appropriate protection mechanisms are in place to safeguard information and 
system  configurations.  Based  on  organizational  policy,  an  individual’s  access  to  resources  
may be more closely monitored or restricted until further review. Logs should be examined 
to identify any attempt to perform unauthorized actions. 
Example 
You learn that one of your employees has been convicted on shoplifting charges. Based on 
organizational policy, you report this information to human resources (HR), which verifies 
the  information  with  a  criminal  background  check  [a,b,c].  Per  policy,  you  increase  the  
monitoring of the employee’s access to ensure that the employee does not exhibit patterns 
of  behavior  consistent  with  an  insider  threat  [d].  You  maintain  contact  with  HR  as  they  
investigate the adverse information so that you can take stronger actions if required, such as 
removing access to organizational systems. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Does  the  organization  define the protection  mechanisms  for  organizational  systems  if  
adverse information develops or is obtained about an individual with access to CUI [d]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
The  constant  evolution  and  increased  sophistication  of  adversaries,  especially  the  APT,  
makes it more likely that adversaries can successfully compromise or breach organizational 
systems.  Accordingly,  threat  intelligence  can  be  integrated  into  each  step  of  the  risk  
management process throughout the system development life cycle. This risk management 
process  includes  defining  system  security  requirements,  developing  system  and  security  
architectures,   selecting   security   solutions,   monitoring   (including   threat   hunting),   and   
remediation efforts. 
[NIST  SP  800-30]  provides  guidance  on  risk  assessments.  [NIST  SP  800-39]  provides  
guidance  on  the  risk  management  process.  [NIST  SP  800-160-1]  provides  guidance  on  
security  architectures  and  systems  security  engineering.  [NIST  SP  800-150]  provides  
guidance on cyber threat information sharing. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
An organization consumes threat intelligence and improves their security posture based on 
the  intelligence  relevant  to  that  organization  and/or  a  system(s). The  organization  can  
obtain   threat   intelligence   from   open   or   commercial   sources   but   must   also   use   any 
DoD-provided  sources.  Threat  information  can  be  received  in  high  volumes  from  various  
providers and must be processed and analyzed by the organization. It is the responsibility of 
the organization to process the threat information in a manner that is useful and actionable 
to  their  needs.  Processing,  analyzing,  and  extracting  the  intelligence  from  the  threat  feeds

and applying it to all organizational security engineering needs is the primary benefit of this 
requirement. Note that more than one source is required to meet assessment objectives. 
Example 
Your   organization   receives   a   commercial   threat intelligence   feed   from   FIRST   and   
government threat intelligence feeds from both USCERT and DoD/DC3 to help learn about 
recent  threats  and  any  additional  information  the  threat  feeds  provide  [b,c,d,e,f]. Your 
organization uses the threat intelligence for multiple purposes: 
• To perform up-to-date risk assessments for the organization [a]; 
• To  add  rules  to  the  automated  system  put  in  place  to  identify  threats  (indicators  of  
compromise, or IOCs) on the organization’s network [e]; 
• To guide the organization in making informed selections of security solutions [c]; 
• To shape the way the organization performs system monitoring activities [d]; 
• To manage the escalation process for identified incidents, handling specific events, and 
performing recovery actions [f]; 
• To provide additional information to the hunt team to identify threat activities [e]; 
• To  inform  the  development  and  design  decisions  for  organizational  systems  and  the  
overall security architecture, as well as the network architecture [b,c]; 
• To assist in decision-making regarding systems that are part of the primary network and 
systems that are placed in special enclaves for additional protections [b]; and 
• To determine additional security measures based on current threat activities taking place 
in similar industry networks [c,d,e,f]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Does the organization detail how threat feed information is to be ingested, analyzed, and 
used [a]? 
• Can  the  organization’s  SOC  or  hunt  teams  discuss  how  they  use  the  threat  feed  
information after it is processed [e,f]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-1
72] 
Threat  hunting  is  an  active  means  of  defense  that  contrasts  with  traditional  protection 
measures,  such  as  firewalls,  intrusion  detection  and  prevention  systems,  quarantining

malicious  code  in  sandboxes,  and  Security  Information  and  Event  Management  (SIEM)  
technologies    and    systems.    Cyber    threat    hunting    involves    proactively    searching    
organizational systems, networks, and infrastructure for advanced threats. The objective is 
to  track  and  disrupt  cyber  adversaries  as  early  as  possible  in  the  attack  sequence  and  to  
measurably  improve  the  speed  and  accuracy  of  organizational  responses.  Indicators  of  
compromise  are  forensic  artifacts  from  intrusions  that  are  identified  on  organizational  
systems  at  the  host  or  network  level  and  can  include  unusual  network  traffic,  unusual  file  
changes, and the presence of malicious code. 
Threat hunting teams use existing threat intelligence and may create new threat information, 
which   may   be   shared   with   peer   organizations,   Information   Sharing   and   Analysis   
Organizations  (ISAO),  Information  Sharing  and  Analysis  Centers  (ISAC),  and  relevant  
government  departments  and  agencies.  Threat  indicators,  signatures,  tactics,  techniques,  
procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be available via government and non-
government cooperatives, including Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, United 
States   Computer   Emergency   Response   Team,   Defense   Industrial   Base   Cybersecurity   
Information Sharing Program, and CERT Coordination Center. 
[NIST SP 800-30] provides guidance on threat and risk assessments, risk analyses, and risk 
modeling. [NIST  SP  800-160-2]  provides  guidance  on  systems  security  engineering  and  
cyber resiliency. [NIST SP 800-150] provides guidance on cyber threat information sharing. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
For this requirement, threat hunting is conducted on an on-going aperiodic basis. On-going 
aperiodic refers to activities that happen over and over but without an identifiable repeating 
pattern over time. For threat hunting, on-going activities take place in an automated manner 
(e.g., collecting   logs,   automated   analysis,   and   alerts). Aperiodicity   includes   humans   
performing the hunt activities, which take place on an as-needed or as-planned basis. 
APTs can penetrate an environment by means that defeat or avoid conventional monitoring 
methods and  alert  triggers—for  example, by  using  zero-day  attacks.  Zero-day  attacks  
become known only after the attack has happened and alerts are sent via threat intelligence 
feeds based on expert analysis. Because of the nature of zero-  day attacks, automated alerts 
do not generally trigger when the event occurs but the activity is captured in system logs and 
forwarded for analysis and retention by the SIEM. Threat intelligence information is typically 
used  by  hunt  teams  to  search  SIEM  systems,  system  event and  security  logs,  and  other  
components  to  identify  activity  that  has  already  taken  place  on  an  environment.  The  hunt  
team  will  identify  systems  related  to  the  event(s)  and  pass  the  case  to  Incident Response 
team  for  action  on the  event(s).  The  hunt  team  will  also  use  indicators  to  identify  smaller  
components  of  an  attack  and  search  for  that  activity,  which  may  help  uncover  a  broader  
attack on the environment. 
Threat hunting can also look for anomalous behavior or activity based on an organization’s 
normal  pattern  of  activity.  Understanding  the  roles  and  information  flows  within  an  
organization can help identify activity that might be indicative of adversary behavior before 
the adversary completes their attack or mission.

Example 
You  are  the  lead  for  your  organization’s  cyber  threat  hunting  team.  You  have  local  and  
remote staff on the team to process threat intelligence. Your team is tied closely with the SOC 
and  IR  teams.  Through  a  DoD  (DC3)  i  ntelligence feed,  you  receive  knowledge  of  a  recent 
APT’s  attacks on defense  contractors.  The  intelligence  feed  provided  the  indicators  of  
compromise  for  a  zero-day  attack  that  most  likely  started  within  the  past  month.  After 
receiving  the  IOCs,  you  use  a  template  for  your  organization  to  place  the  information  in  a  
standard  format  your  team  understands.  You then email  the  information  to  your  team  
members and place the information in your hunt team’s dashboard, which tracks all IOCs [a]. 
Your team starts by using the information to hunt for IOCs on the environment [b]. One of 
your  team  members  quickly  responds,  providing  information from  the  SIEM  that  an  HR  
system’s  logs  show  evidence  that  IOCs  related  to  this  threat  occurred three  days  ago.  The 
team  contacts  the  owner  of  the  system  as  they  take  the  system  offline  into  a  quarantined  
environment. Your team pulls all logs from the system and clones the storage on the system. 
Members go through the logs to look for other systems that may be part of the APT’s attack 
[c]. While the team is cloning the storage system for evidence, you alert the IR team about 
the issue. After full forensics of the system, your team has verified your company has been 
hit by the APT, but nothing was taken and no additional attacks happened. You also alert DoD 
(DC3) about the finding and discuss the matter with them. There is an after action report and 
a briefing given to management to make them aware of the issue. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Does the organization have a methodology for performing cyber threat hunting actions 
[b,c]? 
• Has  the  organization  defined  all  organizational systems  within  scope  of  cyber  threat  
hunting, including valid and approved documentation for any organization systems that 
are not within scope [b,c]? 
• Has  the  organization  identified  a  specific  set  of individuals  to  perform  cyber  threat  
hunting [b,c]? 
• Does  the  threat  hunting  team  have  qualified  staff  members  using  the  threat  feed  
information [b,c]? 
• Does  the  threat  hunting  team  use combinations  of  events  to  determine  suspicious  
behaviors [b,c]? 
• Does  the  organization  have  a  documented  list  of  trusted  threat  feeds  that  are  used  by  
their cyber hunt teams as the latest indicators of compromise during their efforts [a]? 
• Does the organization have a clear methodology for processing threat feed information 
and turning it into actionable information they can use for their threat hunting approach 
[a]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
A  properly  resourced  Security  Operations  Center  (SOC)  or  Computer  Incident  Response  
Team   (CIRT)   may   be   overwhelmed   by   the   volume   of   information   generated   by   the   
proliferation  of  security  tools  and  appliances  unless  it  employs  advanced  automation  and  
analytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and predictive analytics capabilities are 
typically  supported  by  artificial  intelligence  concepts  and  machine  learning.  Examples  
include  Automated  Workflow  Operations,  Automated  Threat  Discovery  and  Response  
(which  includes  broad-based  collection,  context-based  analysis,  and  adaptive  response  
capabilities), and machine-assisted decision tools. 
[NIST SP 800-30] provides guidance on risk assessments and risk analyses. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Advanced automation includes tools to correlate and reduce the cyber data overload created 
by defensive tools, making the data understandable to the analyst. Automation also allows 
the   defensive   mechanisms   to   respond   rapidly   when   adversary   events   are   identified. 
Examples of such capabilities are SIEM;  Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response 
(SOAR); and Extended  Detection  and  Response (XDR) tools.  An  example  of  an  automated  
rapid response action is a security alert being pushed to the SIEM while the organization’s 
SOAR solution communicates to the network firewall to block communications to the remote 
system identified in the security alert. 
SIEM  is primarily  a  log  collection  tool  intended  to  support  data  storage  and  analysis.  It  
collects and sends alerts to security personnel for further investigation. SOAR is a software 
stack  that  enables  an  organization  to  collect  data  about  security  threats  and  respond  to  
security   events   without   human   assistance   in   order   to   improve   security   operations.   
Orchestration connects and integrates disparate internal and external tools. Automation, fed 
by the data and alerts collected from security orchestration, ingests and analyzes data and 
creates repeated, automated responses. SOAR incorporates these capabilities based on the 
SIEM data and enables disparate security tools to coordinate with one another. SOAR can use 
artificial  intelligence  to  predict  and  respond  to  similar  future  threats,  if  such  tools  are  
employed. 
XDR  streamlines  security  data  ingestion,  analysis,  prevention, and  remediation  workflows  
across an organization’s entire security stack, providing a single console to view and act on 
threat data. However, the presence of these tools by themselves does not necessarily provide 
an  advanced  capability.  It  is  essential  that  the  security  team  employ critical  thinking  in  
support of the intrusion detection and threat hunting processes. 
Example 
You  are  responsible  for  information  security  in  your  organization.  The  organization  holds 
and  processes  CUI  in  an  enterprise.  To  protect  that  data, you  want  to  minimize  phishing  
attacks through the use of Security Orchestration and Automated Response (SOAR).   Rather 
than  relying  on  analysts  to  manually  inspect  each  inbound  item,  emails  containing  links 
and/or attachments are processed by your automation playbook. Implementation of these 

 
RA.L3-3.11.3e –   Advanced Risk Identification 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
56 
 
processes  involves  sending  all  email  links  and  attachments  to  detonation  chambers  or  
sandboxes prior to delivery to the recipient. When the email is received, SOAR extracts all 
URL links and attachments from the content and sends them for analysis and testing [a]. The 
domains in the URLs and the full URLs are processed against bad domain and URL lists. Next, 
a browser in a sandbox downloads the URLs for malware testing. Lastly, any attachments are 
sent to detonation chambers to identify if they attempt malicious activities. The hash of the 
attachments is sent to services to identify if it is known malware [b]. If any one of the items 
triggers a malware warning from the sandbox, detonation chamber, domain/URL validation 
service, attachment hash check services, or AV software, an alert about the original email is 
sent  to  team  members  with  the  recommendation  to  quarantine  it.  The  team  is  given  the  
opportunity  to  select  a “take  action”  button, which  would  have  the  SOAR  solution  take  
actions to block that email and similar emails from being received by the organization [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Has the organization implemented a security information and event management system 
[a,c]? 
• Has  the  organization  implemented  security  orchestration,  automation, and  response  
tools [a,b,c]? 
• Does the  organization  use automated processing  integrated  with  the  SIEM  system  to 
perform analytics [c]? 
• Can  the  organization  demonstrate  use of  relevant  threat  data  to  inform  detection  
methods that in turn provide automated alerts/recommendations [c]? 
• Has the organization implemented an extended detection capability [c]? 
• Does the organization have the ability to merge traditional cyber data, such as network 
packet captures (e.g., PCAP),   or process logs with enrichment data, such as reputation or 
categorization data [c]?  
• Can  the  organization  provide  examples  of  both  basic  and  emerging  analytics  used  to  
analyze alert  anomalies,  e.g.,  both  simple  queries  and  unsupervised  machine learning 
algorithms  that both  improve  their  effectiveness  and  automatically  filter,  reduce,  or  
enrich alerting capabilities [c]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-1
72] 
System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and solutions. 
The plans describe how the controls and solutions meet the security requirements. For the 
enhanced  security  requirements  selected  when  the  APT  is  a  concern,  the  security  plan  
provides traceability between threat and risk assessments and the risk-based selection of a 
security solution, including discussion of relevant analyses of alternatives and rationale for 

 
RA.L3-3.11.4e –   Security Solution Rationale 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
58 
 
key security-relevant architectural and design decisions. This level of detail is important as 
the  threat  changes,  requiring  reassessment  of  the  risk  and  the  basis  for  previous  security  
decisions. 
When incorporating external service providers into the system security plan, organizations 
state the type of service provided (e.g., software as a service, platform as a service), the point 
and  type  of  connections  (including  ports  and  protocols),  the  nature  and  type  of  the  
information flows to and from the service provider, and the security controls implemented 
by  the  service  provider.  For  safety  critical  systems,  organizations  document  situations  for  
which safety is the primary reason for not implementing a security solution (i.e., the solution 
is appropriate to address the threat but causes a safety concern). 
[NIST SP 800-18] provides guidance on the development of system security plans. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The System  Security  Plan  (SSP)   is  a  fundamental  component  of  an organization’s  security  
posture. When solutions for implementing a requirement have differing levels of capabilities 
associated with their implementation, it is essential that the plan specifically document the 
rationale  for  the  selected  solution  and  what  was  acquired  for  the  implementation. This 
information  allows  the  organization  to  monitor  the  environment  for  threat  changes  and  
identify  which  solutions  may  no  longer  be  applicable.  While  not  required,  it  may  also  be  
useful to document alternative solutions reviewed and differing levels of risk associated with 
each alternative, as that information may facilitate future analyses when the threat changes. 
In addition to the implementations required for Level 2 certification, which may not be risk 
based, at Level 3, the SSP must carefully document the link between the assessed threat and 
the risk-based selection of a security solution for the enhanced security requirements (i.e., 
all CMMC L3 requirements derived from NIST SP 800-172). 
Example 
You   are   responsible   for   information   security   in   your   organization.   Following   CMMC   
requirement  RA.L3-3.11.1e  – Threat  Informed  Risk  Assessment,   your  team  uses  threat  
intelligence to complete a risk assessment and make a risk determination for all elements of 
your   enterprise.   Based   on   that   view   of   risk,   your   team   decides   that   requirement 
RA.L3-3.11.2e – Threat Hunting is a requirement that is very important in protecting your 
organization’s use of CUI, and you have determined the solution selected could potentially 
add risk. You want to detect an adversary as soon as possible when they breach the network 
before any CUI can be exfiltrated. However, there are multiple threat hunting solutions, and 
each  solution  has  a  different  set  of  features  that  will  provide  different  success  rates  in  
identifying IOCs. 
As  a  result,  some  solutions  increase  the  risk  to  the  organization  by  being  less  capable  in 
detecting  and  tracking  an  adversary  in  your  networks.  To  reduce  risk,  you  evaluate  five 
threat hunting solutions and in each case determine the number of IOCs for which there is a 
monitoring  mechanism.  You  pick  the  solution  that  is  cost  effective,  easy  to  operate,  and  
optimizes IOC detection for your enterprise; purchase, install, and train SOC personnel on its 
use;  and  document  the  risk-based  analysis  of  alternatives  in  the  SSP.  In  creating  that

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
Threat  awareness  and  risk  assessment  of  the  organization  are  dynamic,  continuous,  and  
inform system operations, security requirements for the system, and the security solutions 
employed to meet those requirements. Threat intelligence (i.e., threat information that has 
been  aggregated,  transformed,  analyzed,  interpreted,  or  enriched  to  help  provide  the  
necessary  context  for  decision  making)  is  infused  into  the  risk  assessment  processes  and  
information  security  operations  of  the  organization  to  identify  any  changes  required  to  
address the dynamic threat environment. 
[NIST  SP  800-30]  provides  guidance  on  risk  assessments,  threat  assessments,  and  risk  
analyses. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
This requirement requires the organization to analyze threat intelligence and consider the 
effectiveness  of  currently  deployed  cybersecurity  solutions  against  existing,  new,  and  
emerging  threats.  The  goal  is  to  understand  the  risk  to  the  systems  and  the  organization  
based on threat intelligence and to make adjustments to security solutions to reduce the risk 
to  an  acceptable  level.  Analysis  of  solutions  should  include  analysis  of  operational  system  
settings  of  the  deployed  systems  and  not  be  solely  a  conceptual  capability  analysis.  This 
analysis   includes   verifying   configuration   settings   are   configured   as   desired   by   the   
organization and have not been changed over time. 
Threat information can be thought of as raw data that may be limited in terms of evaluating 
the effectiveness of controls across the enterprise. For example, knowledge of a threat that 
has  not  been  correlated  with  other  threats  may  result  in  evaluation  of  an  implementation  
that only provides partial protection for one set of systems when, in fact, the emerging threat 
is  applicable  to  the  entire  enterprise.  Large  organizations  may  also  have  the  resources  to  
aggregate,  transform,  analyze,  correlate,  interpret,  and  enrich  information  to  support  
decision-making about adequacy of existing security mechanisms and methods. 
Example 
You   are   responsible   for   information   security   in   your   organization,   which   holds   and   
processes  CUI.  The  organization  subscribes  to  multiple threat  intelligence  sources [b]. In 
order to assess the effectiveness of current security solutions, the security team analyzes any 
new incidents reported in the threat feed. They identify weaknesses that were leveraged by 
malicious  actors  and  subsequently  look  for  similar  weaknesses  in  their  own  security  
architecture[a,c]. This  analysis  is  passed  to  the  architecture  team  for  engineering  change  
recommendations, including system patching guidance, new sensors, and associated alerts 
that  should  be  generated,  and  to  identify  ways  to  mitigate,  transfer,  or  accept  the  risk  
necessary to respond to events if they occur within their own organization [d].

Supply   chain   events   include   disruption,   use   of   defective   components,   insertion   of   
counterfeits,  theft,  malicious  development  practices,  improper  delivery  practices,  and  
insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on a system and its 
information   and,   therefore,   can   also   adversely   impact   organizational   operations   (i.e., 
mission,   functions,   image,   or   reputation),   organizational   assets,   individuals,   other   
organizations,  and  the  Nation.  The  supply  chain-related  events  may  be  unintentional  or  
malicious and can occur at any point during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain

risk  can  help  an  organization  identify  systems  or  components  for  which  additional  supply  
chain risk mitigations are required. 
[NIST  SP  800-30]  provides  guidance  on  risk  assessments,  threat  assessments,  and  risk  
analyses. [NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1] provides guidance on supply chain risk management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Organizations will have varying policies, definitions, and actions for this requirement. It is 
important for a single organization to be consistent and to build a process that makes sense 
for their organization, strategy, unique supply chain, and the technologies available to them. 
Example  
You   are   responsible   for   information   security   in   your   organization, which   holds   and   
processes  CUI.  One  of  your  responsibilities  is  to  manage  risk  associated  with  your  supply  
chain that may provide an entry point for the adversary. First, you acquire threat information 
by subscribing to reports that identify supply chain attacks in enough detail that you are able 
to identify the risk points in your organization’s supply chain [a]. You create an organization-
defined prioritized list of risks the organization may encounter and determine the responses 
to be implemented to mitigate those risks [b,c]. 
In addition to incident information, the intelligence provider also makes recommendations 
for monitoring and auditing your supply chain. You assess, integrate, correlate, and analyze 
this information so you can use it to acquire monitoring tools to help identify supply chain 
events that could be an indicator of an incident. This monitoring tool provides visibility of 
the entire attack surface, including your vendors’  security posture [d]. Second, you analyze 
the incident information in the intelligence report to help identify defensive tools that will 
help respond to each of those known supply chain attack techniques as soon as possible after 
such an incident is detected, thus mitigating risk associated with known techniques. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Has the organization prioritized risks to the supply chain [a,b]? 
• Does  the  organization  have  viable  service-level  agreements  that  describe  and  enable  
responses to supply chain incidents [c,d]?

DISCUSSION [NIST S
P 800-172] 
The growing dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, along 
with the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk 
to  an  organization.  Threat  actions  that may  increase  risk  include  the  insertion  or  use  of  
counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and 
hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply 
chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an

organization,   a   sector,   or   the   Nation.   Managing   supply   chain   risk   is   a   multifaceted   
undertaking  that  requires  a  coordinated  effort  across  an  organization  to  build  trust  
relationships and communicate with both internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain 
risk  management  (SCRM)  activities  involve  identifying  and  assessing  risks,  determining  
appropriate  mitigating  actions,  developing  SCRM  plans  to  document  selected  mitigating  
actions,  and  monitoring  performance  against  plans.  SCRM  plans  address  requirements  for  
developing trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and system components, including the 
application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems 
security engineering processes. 
[NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1] provides guidance on supply chain risk management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
An organization is required to have a supply chain risk management plan that assesses and 
responds  to  the  identified  risks  from  those  organizations  that  provide  IT  products  or  
services, including any cloud or other third-party services with a role in the operation of the 
system. The organization should be cognizant of services outside the scope of the system but 
required for the operation of the system as part of their plan. Since the cyber environment 
changes rapidly and continuously, it is equally important for the organization to update the 
plan in response to supply chain cyber incidents or emerging information. 
Example 
You  are  responsible  for  information  security  in  your  organization,  and  you  have  created  a  
supply chain risk management plan [a,b,c]. One of the organization’s suppliers determines 
that it has been the victim of a cyberattack. Your security team meets with the  supplier  to  
determine the nature of the attack and to understand the adversary, the attack, the potential 
for  corruption  of  delivered  goods  or  services,  and current  as  well  as  future  risks. The 
understanding of the supply chain will help protect the local environment. Subsequently, you 
update  the  risk  management  plan  to  include  a  description  of  the  necessary  configuration  
changes or upgrades to monitoring tools to improve the ability to identify the new risks, and 
when improved  tools  are  available,  you  document  the  acquisition  of  defensive  tools  and 
associated functionality to help mitigate any of the identified techniques [d]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Does  the  organization’s  current  supply  chain  risk  management  plan  apply  across  the  
enterprise, or does it only apply to a limited portion of the supply chain [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST S
P 800-172] 
Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or individual 
system  components  to  identify  vulnerabilities  that  could  be  exploited  by  adversaries.  
Penetration  testing  goes  beyond  automated  vulnerability  scanning.  It  is  conducted  by  
penetration  testing  agents  and  teams  with  particular  skills  and  experience  that  include  
technical expertise in network, operating system, and application-level security. Penetration 
testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine a system’s penetration resistance 
to  adversaries  within  specified  constraints.  Such  constraints  include  time,  resources,  and  

 
CA.L3-3.12.1e –   Penetration Testing 
CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
68 
 
skills. Organizations may also supplement penetration testing with red team exercises. Red 
teams  attempt  to  duplicate  the  actions  of  adversaries  in  carrying  out  attacks  against  
organizations   and   provide   an   in-depth   analysis   of   security-related   weaknesses   or   
deficiencies. 
Organizations  can  use  the  results  of  vulnerability  analyses  to  support  penetration  testing  
activities.  Penetration  testing  can  be  conducted  internally  or  externally  on  the  hardware,  
software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical 
controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes pretest analysis based on full 
knowledge  of  the  system,  pretest  identification  of  potential  vulnerabilities  based  on  the  
pretest  analysis,  and  testing  designed  to  determine  the  exploitability  of  vulnerabilities.  All  
parties agree to the specified rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration 
testing.  Organizations  correlate  the  rules  of  engagement  for  penetration  tests  and  red  
teaming exercises (if used) with the tools, techniques, and procedures that they anticipate 
adversaries may employ. The penetration testing or red team exercises may be organization-
based or external to the organization. In either case, it is important that the team possesses 
the necessary skills and resources to do the job and is objective in its assessment. 
[NIST SP 800-53A] provides guidance on conducting security assessments. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
It  is  important that  the  organization  has  a  repeatable  penetration  testing  capability,  
regardless  of  who  performs  the  penetration  testing.  This requirement entails  performing  
tests against components of the organization’s architecture to identify cyber weaknesses and 
vulnerabilities. It does not mean everything in the architecture requires penetration testing. 
This requirement provides findings and mitigation strategies that benefit the organization 
and  help  create  a  stronger  environment  against  adversary  efforts.  It  may  be  beneficial  for  
the organization to define the scope of penetration testing.  The organization’s approach may 
involve  hiring  an  expert  penetration  testing  team  to  perform  testing  on  behalf  of  the  
organization. When an organization has penetration testing performed, either by an internal 
team or external firm, they should establish rules of engagement and impose limits on what 
can be performed by the penetration test team(s). 
Ensuring the objectivity of the test team is important as well. Potential conflicts of interest, 
such  as  having  internal  testers  report  directly  or  indirectly  to  network  defenders  or  an  
external test team contracted by network defense leadership, must be carefully managed by 
organizational leadership. 
Reports on the  findings  should  be  used  by  the  organization  to  determine  where  to  focus  
funding, staffing, training, or technical improvements for future mitigation strategies.

• If   the   penetration   testing   is performed   by   an   internal   team,   are   the   individuals 
performing the testing objectively [b]? 
• Is a  penetration testing  final  report provided to  the  internal  team  responsible  for  
organizational defense? 
• If previous penetration tests have been conducted, can the organization provide samples 
of penetration test plans, findings reports, and mitigation guidance based on the findings

DISCUSSION [NIST S
P 800-172] 
A mix of physical and logical isolation techniques (described below) implemented as part of 
the  system  architecture  can  limit  the  unauthorized  flow  of  CUI,  reduce  the  system  attack  
surface, constrain the number of system components that must be secure, and impede the 
movement  of  an  adversary.  When  implemented  with  a  set  of  managed  interfaces,  physical  
and logical isolation techniques for organizational systems and components can isolate CUI 
into  separate  security  domains  where  additional  protections  can  be  implemented.  Any  
communications across the managed interfaces (i.e., across security domains), including for 
management    or    administrative    purposes,    constitutes    remote    access    even    if    the    
communications  remain  within  the  organization.  Separating  system  components  with  
boundary   protection   mechanisms   allows   for   the   increased   protection   of   individual   
components  and  more  effective  control  of  information  flows  between  those  components.  
This enhanced protection limits the potential harm from and susceptibility to hostile cyber-
attacks and errors. The degree of isolation can vary depending on the boundary protection 
mechanisms  selected.  Boundary  protection  mechanisms  include  routers,  gateways,  and  
firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks; 
virtualization  and  micro-virtualization  techniques;  encrypting  information  flows  among  
system   components   using   distinct   encryption   keys;   cross-domain   devices   separating   
subnetworks; and complete physical separation (i.e., air gaps). 
System  architectures  include  logical  isolation,  partial  physical  and  logical  isolation,  or  
complete   physical   isolation   between   subsystems   and   at   system   boundaries   between   
resources  that  store,  process,  transmit,  or  protect  CUI  and  other  resources.  Examples  
include: 
• Logical   isolation:   Data   tagging,   digital   rights   management   (DRM),   and   data   loss   
prevention (DLP) that tags, monitors, and restricts the flow of CUI; virtual machines or 
containers  that  separate  CUI  and  other  information  on  hosts;  and  virtual  local  area  
networks (VLAN) that keep CUI and other information separate on networks. 
• Partial physical and logical isolation: Physically or cryptographically isolated networks, 
dedicated hardware in data centers, and secure clients that (a) may not directly access 
resources  outside  of  the  domain  (i.e.,  all  applications  with  cross-enclave  connectivity  
execute as remote virtual applications hosted in a demilitarized zone [DMZ] or internal 
and protected enclave), (b) access via remote virtualized applications or virtual desktop 
with  no  file  transfer  capability  other  than  with  dual  authorization,  or  (c)  employ  
dedicated  client  hardware  (e.g.,  a  zero  or  thin  client)  or  hardware  approved  for  multi-
level secure (MLS) usage. 
• Complete   physical   isolation:   Dedicated   (not   shared)   client   and   server   hardware;   
physically  isolated,  stand-alone  enclaves  for  clients  and  servers;  and  (a)  logically  
separate network traffic (e.g., using a VLAN) with end-to-end encryption using Public Key 
Infrastructure (PKI)-based cryptography or (b) physical isolation from other networks.

Isolation techniques are selected based on a risk management perspective that balances the 
threat,   the   information   being   protected,   and   the   cost   of   the   options   for   protection.   
Architectural  and  design  decisions  are  guided  and  informed  by  the  security  requirements  
and   selected   solutions.   Organizations   consider   the   trustworthiness   of   the   isolation   
techniques employed (e.g., the logical isolation relies on information technology that could 
be considered a high value target because of the function being performed), introducing its 
own set of vulnerabilities. 
[NIST  SP  800-160-1]  provides  guidance  on  developing  trustworthy,  secure,  and  cyber  
resilient systems using systems security engineering practices and security design concepts. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
For  this  requirement,  organizations  must identify  the  systems  or  enclaves  that  need  to  be  
isolated,  then  design  and  implement  the  isolation.  The  resulting  isolation  solutions  are 
documented or  referenced  in  the  SSP.  Documentation  will  be  dependent  on  the  design  
selected and may include a high-level diagram, but specific details that may change on some 
frequency  would  be  omitted.  During  an  assessment,  providing  details  such  as  subnet  and 
VLAN  implementation  identifiers,  internal  boundary  protection  hardware  and  software, 
interface  device  functionality,  and  system  configuration  and  Access  Control  List  (ACL) 
settings will be useful. 
Example 
You   are   responsible   for   information   security   in   your   organization, which   holds   and   
processes  CUI.  You  have  decided to  isolate  the systems  processing CUI by  limiting  all 
communications in and out that enclave with cross-domain interface devices that implement 
access  control  [a]. Your  security  team  has  identified  all  the  systems  containing  such  CUI, 
documented  network  design  details,  developed  network  diagrams  showing  access  control  
points, documented  the  logic  for  the  access  control  enforcement  decisions,  described the 
interface and protocol to the identification and authentication mechanisms, and documented 
all  details  associated  with  the  ACLs,  including  review,  updates,  and  credential  revocation 
procedures. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Has the organization clearly identified where they use physical, logical, or both isolation 
techniques [a]? 
• Can the organization describe the isolation techniques they have employed [a]? 
• Has  the  organization  deployed  subnetting,  internal  firewalls,  and  VLANs  to  control  
packet flow between internal segments [a]? 
• Does the organization employ metadata to inform isolation techniques [a]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172] 
Verifying  the  integrity  of  the  organization’s  security-critical  or  essential  software  is  an  
important   capability   since   corrupted   software   is   the   primary   attack   vector   used   by   
adversaries to undermine or disrupt the proper functioning of organizational systems. There 
are  many  ways  to  verify  software  integrity  throughout  the  system  development  life  cycle.  
Root  of  trust  mechanisms  (e.g.,  secure  boot,  trusted  platform  modules,  Unified  Extensible  
Firmware Interface [UEFI]), verify that only trusted code is executed during boot processes. 
This   capability   helps   system   components   protect   the   integrity   of   boot   firmware   in   
organizational systems by verifying the integrity and authenticity of updates to the firmware 
prior to applying changes to the system component and preventing unauthorized processes 
from modifying the boot firmware. The employment of cryptographic signatures ensures the 
integrity  and  authenticity  of  critical  and  essential  software  that  stores,  processes,  or  
transmits, CUI. Cryptographic signatures include digital signatures and the computation and 
application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality 
of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information. 
Hardware roots of trust are considered to be more secure. This requirement supports 3.4.1e 
and 3.4.3.e. 
[FIPS  140-3]  provides  security  requirements  for  cryptographic  modules.  [FIPS  180-4]  and  
[FIPS  202]  provide  secure  hash  standards.  [FIPS  186-4]  provides  a  digital  signature  
standard. [NIST  SP  800-147]  provides  BIOS  protection  guidance.  [NIST  TRUST]  provides  
guidance on the roots of trust project. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Organizations verify the integrity of security critical and essential software every time that 
software is  executed.  Secure  boot  mechanisms  for  firmware  and  a  cryptographically  
protected boot chain ensure the integrity of the operating system (OS)   and security critical 
software,   and   cryptographic   techniques   ensure   the essential software   has   not   been   
tampered  with  after  development  prior  to  execution.  If  software  is itself considered  to  be 
CUI or if it uses CUI, this requirement ensures it has not been compromised. 
Software and information integrity verification tools can help check the integrity during the 
development  process  for  those  organizations  developing  software. As  critical  software  is  
updated,  the  integrity  of  any  configuration  data  and  the  software  must  result  in  updated  
signatures and an ongoing verification process. 
Operating systems include mechanisms to validate digital signatures for installed software. 
Most software packages use signatures to prove the integrity of the provided software, and 
the  organization  should  leverage  these  capabilities.  Similarly,  most  hardware  appliance  
vendors have secure boot checks in place for their devices and built-in features that check 
the  digital  signature  of  an  upgrade/update  package  before  they  allow  an  upgrade  to  take  
place. For locally developed software, the organization should sign the software to ensure its 
integrity.

Example 1 
You  are  responsible  for  information  security  in  your  organization.  Your  security  team  has 
identified the software used to process CUI, and the organization has decided it is mission-
critical software that must be protected. You take three actions. First, you ensure all of the 
platform’s configuration information used at boot is hashed and stored in a TPM [a]. Second, 
you ensure that the platforms used to execute the software are started with a digitally signed 
software chain to a    secure  boot   process  using  the  TPM.  Finally, you  ensure the  essential  
applications  are  cryptographically  protected  with  a  digital  signature  when  stored  and the 
signature is verified prior to execution [b]. 
Example 2 
Your organization has a software security team, and they are required to validate unsigned 
essential software provided to systems that do not have TPM modules. The organization has 
a policy stating no software can be executed on a system unless its hash value matches that 
of a hash stored in the approved software library kept by the software security team [a]. This 
action  is  performed  by  implementing  software  restriction  policies  on  systems.  The  team  
tests  the  software  on  a  sandbox  system,  and  once  it  is  proven  safe,  they  run  a  hashing  
function on the software to create a hash value. This hash value is placed in a software library 
so the system will know it can execute the software [b]. Any changes to the software without 
the  software  security  team’s  approval  will  result  in  the  software  failing  the  security  tests, 
and it will be prevented from executing. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Does   the   organization   use   cryptographic   signatures   to   ensure   the   integrity   and   
authenticity of critical and essential software and data [b]? 
• Has  the  organization  identified  those  devices  that  require  integrity  verification  of  the  
boot process [a]? 
• Does   the   organization   use   a   TPM   to   store hashes   of   pre-run   time   configuration   
parameters for those systems [b]? 
• Does the organization leverage the TPM configuration hash to verify the hardware and 
software configuration is unchanged in order to determine that a system is trustworthy 
before running mission-essential applications [b,c]? 
• Does the organization use the TPM for remote attestation to determine to which extent 
information can be trusted from another system [b,c]? 
• Has   the   organization   identified   devices   requiring   organization-defined   security   
safeguards that must be implemented to protect the integrity of boot firmware [a]? 
• Has the organization defined security safeguards that will be implemented to protect the 
integrity of boot firmware in mission-essential devices [a]? 
• Has  the  organization  implemented  organization-defined  security  safeguards  to  protect  
the integrity of boot firmware in organization-defined essential devices [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-1
72] 
Organizations  may  have  a  variety  of  systems  and  system  components  in  their  inventory,  
including  Information  Technology  (IT),  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  Operational  Technology  
(OT),  and  Industrial  Internet  of  Things  (IIoT).  The  convergence  of  IT,  OT,  IoT,  and  IIoT  
significantly increases the attack surface of organizations and provides attack vectors that 
are challenging to address. Compromised IoT, OT, and IIoT system components can serve as 
launching points for attacks on organizational IT systems that handle CUI. Some IoT, OT, and 
IIoT   system   components   can   store,   transmit,   or   process   CUI   (e.g.,   specifications   or   
parameters  for  objects  manufactured  in  support  of  critical  programs).  Most  of  the  current  
generation  of  IoT,  OT,  and  IIoT  system  components  are  not  designed  with  security  as  a  
foundational property and may not be able to be configured to support security functionality. 
Connections  to  and  from  such  system  components  are  generally  not  encrypted,  do  not  
provide  the  necessary  authentication,  are  not  monitored,  and  are  not  logged.  Therefore,  
these  components  pose  a  significant  cyber  threat.  Gaps  in  IoT,  OT,  and  IIoT  security  
capabilities  may  be  addressed  by  employing  intermediary  system  components  that  can  
provide   encryption,   authentication,   security   scanning,   and   logging   capabilities—thus, 
preventing   the   components   from   being   accessible   from   the   Internet.   However,   such   
mitigation   options   are   not   always   available   or   practicable.   The   situation   is   further   
complicated  because  some  of  the  IoT,  OT,  and  IIoT  devices  may  be  needed  for  essential  
missions  and  business  functions.  In  those  instances,  it  is  necessary  for  such  devices  to  be  
isolated from the Internet to reduce the susceptibility to cyber-attacks.  
[NIST  SP  800-160-1]  provides  guidance  on  security  engineering  practices  and  security  
design concepts. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION  
Specialized Assets are addressed in the scoping guidance, which should be overlaid on this 
requirement.  The OSC  must document Specialized  Assets  in  the  asset  inventory;  develop, 
document, and periodically update system security plans; and include Specialized Assets in 
the  network  diagram.  The  Specialized  Asset  section  of  the  SSP  should  describe associated 
system  boundaries,  system  environments  of  operation,  how  security  requirements  are  
implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems. 
Specialized  Assets  within  the  Level  3  CMMC  assessment scope must  be either assessed 
against  all  CMMC  security requirements or separated into  purpose-specific  networks.  
Specialized Assets may have limitations on the application of certain security requirements. 
To accommodate such issues, the SSP should describe any mitigations. 
Intermediary devices are permitted to mitigate an inability for the asset itself to implement 
one or more CMMC requirements. An example of an intermediary device used in conjunction 
with a specialized asset is a boundary device or a proxy. 
The high-level list of Specialized Assets includes:

• Government Furnished Equipment; 
• IoT   and   IIoT   devices   (physical   or   virtual)   with   sensing/actuation   capability   and   
programmability features; 
• OT used  in  manufacturing  systems,  industrial  control  systems  (ICS),  or  supervisory  
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems; 
• Restricted Information Systems, which can include systems and IT components that are 
configured based on government requirements; and 
• Test equipment. 
Example 
You are responsible for information security in your organization, which processes CUI on 
the network, and this same network includes GFE for which the configuration is mandated 
by the government. The GFE is needed to process CUI information [a]. Because the company 
cannot manage the configuration of the GFE, it has been augmented by placing a bastion host 
between it and the network. The bastion host meets the requirements that the GFE cannot, 
and is used to send CUI files to and from the GFE for processing. You and your security team 
document in the SSP all of the GFE to include GFE connectivity diagrams, a description of the 
isolation  mechanism,  and  a description  of  how  your  organization  manages  risk  associated  
with that GFE [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Has the organization documented all specialized assets in asset inventory [a]? 
• Has  the  organization  documented  all  specialized  assets  in  the  SSP  to  show  how  risk  is  
managed [b]? 
• Has the organization provided a network diagram for specialized assets [a,b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST S
P 800-172] 
Threat  information  related  to  specific  threat  events  (e.g.,  TTPs,  targets)  that  organizations  
have  experienced,  threat  mitigations  that  organizations  have  found  to  be  effective  against  
certain types of threats, and threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats 
that  can  occur)  are  sourced  from  and  shared  with  trusted  organizations.  This  threat  
information   can   be   used   by   organizational   Security   Operations   Centers   (SOC)   and   
incorporated  into  monitoring  capabilities.  Threat  information  sharing  includes  threat  
indicators,  signatures,  and  adversary  TTPs  from  organizations  participating  in  threat-
sharing   consortia,   government-commercial   cooperatives,   and   government-government 
cooperatives  (e.g.,  CERTCC,  CISA/US-CERT,  FIRST,  ISAO,  DIB  CS  Program).  Unclassified  
indicators,  based  on  classified  information  but  which  can  be  readily  incorporated  into  
organizational    intrusion    detection    systems,    are    available    to    qualified    nonfederal    
organizations from government sources. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
One way to effectively leverage threat indicator information is to access human-  or machine-
readable threat intelligence feeds. Effectiveness may also require the organization to create 
TTPs  in  support  of  operational  requirements,  which will  typically  include  defensive  cyber  
tools  supporting  incident  detection, alerts,  incident  response,  and  threat  hunting.  It  is  
possible  that  this  requirement will  be  implemented  by  a  third-party  managed  service  
provider,  and  in  that case,  it will be  necessary  to  carefully  define  the  boundary  and  
responsibilities between the OSC and the ESP to guarantee a robust implementation. It is also 
important that the OSC validate threat indicator integration into the defensive cyber toolset 
by being  able  to  (1) implement mitigations  for  sample  industry  relevant  indicators of 
compromise (e.g., IP address, file hash), (  2) identify sample indicators   of compromise across 
sample  endpoints,  and (3)  identify  sample  indicators of  compromise  using  analytical

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 | Version 2.13 
82 
 
Example 
You are responsible for information security in your organization. You have maintained an 
effective  intrusion  detection  capability  for  some  time,  but  now  you  decide  to  introduce  a  
threat hunting capability informed by internal and external threat intelligence [a,c,d,e]. You 
install a SIEM system that leverages threat information to provide functionality to: 
• analyze logs, data sources, and alerts; 
• query data to identify anomalies; 
• identify variations from baseline threat levels; 
• provide machine learning capabilities associated with the correlation of anomalous data 
characteristics across the enterprise; and 
• categorize data sets based on expected data values. 
Your team also manages an internal mitigation plan (playbook) for all known threats for your 
environment. This playbook is used to implement effective mitigation strategies across the 
environment  [b].  Some  of  the  mitigation  strategies  are  developed  by  team  members,  and  
others are obtained by threat feed services. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
• Which external sources has the organization identified as threat information sources [a]? 
• Does the organization understand the TTPs of key attackers [c,d]? 
• Does  the  organization  deploy  threat  indicators  to  EDR  systems,  network  intrusion 
detection systems, or both [c,d,e]? 
• What actions does the organization implement when a threat alert/indicator is signaled 
[c,d,e]? 
• Does the organization use internal threat capabilities within their existing security tools 
[e]? 
• How does the organization respond to a third-party notification of a threat indicator [e]?
