Limit access  to  applications  and  data based on the authorized users’  roles and responsibilities. Common types of functions a user can be assigned are create, read, update, and delete. Example Your team manages DoD contracts for your company. Members of your team need to access the contract information to perform their work properly. Because some of that data contains CUI, you work with IT to set up your group’s systems so that users can be assigned access based  on  their  specific  roles [a].  Each  role  limits  whether  an  employee  has  read-access  or create/read/delete/update -access [b]. Implementing this access control restricts access to CUI information unless specifically authorized. Potential Assessment Considerations • Are access control lists used to limit access to applications and data based on role and/or identity [a]? • Is access for authorized users restricted to those parts of the system they are explicitly permitted  to  use  (e.g.,  a  person  who  only  performs  word-processing  cannot  access developer tools) [b]?

If it does, the device allows the information to pass to its destination [b]. The proxy blocks traffic that does not meet policy requirements [e]. Example 2 As a subcontractor on a DoD contract, your organization sometimes needs to transmit CUI to the prime contractor. You create a policy document that specifies who is allowed to transmit CUI and that such transmission requires manager approval [a,c,d]. The policy instructs users to  encrypt any  CUI  transmitted  via  email  or  to  use  a  designated  secure  file  sharing  utility [b,d]. The policy states that users who do not follow appropriate procedures may be subject to disciplinary action [e].

Documenting  and  dividing  elements  of important  duties  and  tasks  between  employees reduces intentional or unintentional execution of malicious activities. Example 1 You are responsible  for  the  management  of  several  key  systems  within  your  organization including  some  that  process  CUI.  You  assign  the  task  of  reviewing  the  system  logs  to  two different  people.  This  way,  no  one  person  is  solely  responsible  for  the  execution  of  this critical security function [c]. Example 2 You are a system a dministrator. Human Resources notifies you of a new hire, and you create an account with general privileges, but you are not allowed to grant access to systems that contain CUI  [a,b]. The  program  manager  contacts  the  team  in  your  organization  that  has system administration authority over the CUI systems and informs them which CUI the new hire  will  need  to  access.  Subsequently, a second  system  administrator  grants  access privileges to the new hire [c].

You  should  log  on  to  another  computer  with your non-privileged account before you connect to the web and start searching for the reset information [b]. That way, if your account is compromised during the search, it will be your regular user account rather than an account with elevated privileges.

After an unsuccessful login attempt threshold is exceeded and the system locks an account, the account may either remain locked until an administrator takes action to unlock it, or it may be locked for a predefined time after which it unlocks automatically. Example You attempt to log on to your work computer, which stores CUI. You mistype your password three times in a row, and an error message is generated telling you the account is locked [b]. You  call  your  IT  help  desk  or  system  administrator  to  request  assistance.  The  system administrator  explains  that  the  account  is  locked  as  a  result  of  three  unsuccessful  logon attempts [a]. The administrator offers to unlock the account and notes that you can wait 30 minutes for the account to unlock automatically.

One  method  of  addressing  this  requirement  is  the  use  of  a system-use  notification  banner  that  displays  the  legal  requirements  of  using  the  system. Users may be required to click to agree to the displayed requirements of using the system each time they log on to the machine. This agreement can be used in the civil and/or criminal prosecution of an attacker that violates the terms. The  legal  notification  should  meet all  applicable  requirements.  At  a  minimum,  the  notice should inform the user that: • information system usage may be monitored or recorded, and is subject to audit; • unauthorized use of the information systems is prohibited; • unauthorized use is subject to criminal and civil penalties; • use of the information system affirms consent to monitoring and recording; • the   information   system   contains   CUI   with   specific   requirements   imposed by   the Department of Defense; and • use of the information system may be subject to other specified requirements associated with certain types of CUI such as Export Controlled information. Example You are setting up IT equipment including a database server that will contain CUI. You have worked  with  legal  counsel  to  draft  a  notification.  It  contains  both  general  and  specific  CUI security and privacy requirements [a]. The system displays the required security and privacy information before anyone logs on to your organization’s computers that contain or provide access to CUI [b]. Potential Assessment Considerations • Are objectives identified for privacy and security notices, and does the implementation satisfy  the  required  objectives  [a,b]?  Discrepancies  may  indicate  a  deficient  process and/or an incomplete objective for the overall requirement. • Are there any special requirements associated with the specific CUI category [a]? • Are  appropriate  notices  displayed  in  areas  where  paper-based  CUI  is  stored  and processed [b]?

Session termination policies can be simple or sophisticated. Examples are inactivity (end the session after  a  specified  duration  (e.g.,  one  hour 33 )  of  inactivity),  day/time  (all  sessions  are terminated at the end of the established workday), misbehavior (end the session due to an attempted policy violation), and maintenance (terminate sessions to prevent issues with an upgrade or service outage). If there is no automatic control of user sessions, an attacker can take advantage of an unattended session. Example 1 You manage  systems  containing  CUI  for  your  organization  and  configure  the  system  to terminate all user sessions after 1 hour of inactivity [a]. As the session timeout approaches, the system prompts users with a warning banner asking if they want to continue the session. When the session timeout does occur, the login page pops up, and the users must log in to start a new session [b]. Example 2 A user is logged into a corporate database containing CUI but is not authorized to view CUI. The user has submitted a series of queries that unintentionally violate policy, as they attempt to  extract  CUI  that  the  user  is  not  authorized  to  view  [a].  The  session  terminates  with  a warning  as  a  result  of  a  violation  of  corporate  policy  [b].  The  user  must  reestablish  the session before being able to submit additional legitimate queries. Potential Assessment Considerations • Are  the  conditions  in  which  a  user  session  must  be  terminated  described  (e.g.,  after  a period of inactivity or after a defined time limit) [a]? • Are  procedures  documented  that  describe  how  to  configure  the  system  to  enable automatic termination of user sessions after any of the defined conditions occur [b]? • Are user sessions terminated based on organization-defined conditions [a,b]?

WPA2   is   typically   configured   to   use   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. • WPA2  Enterprise  - This  method  may  be  better  for  larger  companies  and  enterprise networks because authentication is based on the identity of the individual user or device rather   than   a   shared   password   or   passphrase.   It   typically   requires   a   Remote Authentication Dial-i  n User Service (RADIUS) server for authentication and can provide higher security than WPA2-PSK. Open authentication must not be used because it authenticates any user and lacks security capabilities. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11.

Example 1 You manage  the  wireless  network  at  a  small  company  and  are  installing  a  new  wireless solution  that  may  transmit  CUI.  You  start  by  selecting  a  product  that  employs  encryption validated against the FIPS 140 standard. You configure the wireless solution to use WPA2, requiring users to enter a pre-shared key to connect to the wireless network [a,b].

You start by selecting a product that employs encryption that is  validated  against  the  FIPS  140  standard.  Because  of  the  size  of  your  workforce,  you configure  the  wireless  system  to  authenticate  users  with  a  RADIUS  server.  Users  must provide  the  wireless  system  with  their  domain  usernames  and  passwords  to  be  able  to connect, and the RADIUS server verifies those credentials. Users unable to authenticate are denied access [a,b]. Potential Assessment Considerations • Is  wireless  access  limited  only  to  authenticated  and  authorized  users  (e.g.,  required  to supply a username and password) [a]? • If  the  organization  is  securing  its  wireless  network  with  a  pre-shared  key,  is  access  to that key restricted to only authorized users [a]? • Is wireless access encrypted using FIPS-validated cryptography?

FURTHER DISCUSSION Establish   guidelines   and   acceptable   requirements   for   proper   configuration,   use,   and management  of  mobile  devices.  Devices  that  process,  store,  or  transmit  CUI  must  be identified with a device-specific identifier. There are many different types of identifiers, and it  is  important  to  select  one  that  can  accommodate  all  devices  and  be  used  in  a  consistent manner. These identifiers are important for facilitating the required monitoring and logging function. In addition to smartphones, consider the security of other portable devices such as e-readers and tablets. AC.L2-3.1.16, AC.L2-3.1.17, and AC.L2-3.1.18 are complementary requirements in that they all establish control for the connection of mobile devices and wireless devices through the use of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. Example Your organization has a policy stating that all mobile devices, including iPads, tablets, mobile phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs),    must be approved and registered with the IT department before connecting to the network that contains CUI. The IT department uses a Mobile Device Management solution to monitor mobile devices and enforce policies across the enterprise [b,c]. Potential Assessment Considerations • Is a list of mobile devices that are permitted to process, store, or transmit CUI maintained [a,b]? • Is the system configured to only permit connections from identified, authorized mobile devices [b]?

FURTHER DISCUSSION A portable storage device is a system component that can be inserted or attached and easily removed from a system. It is used to store data or information. Examples of portable storage devices include: • compact/digital video disks (CDs/DVDs); • Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives; • external hard disk drives; • flash memory cards/drives;  and • floppy disks. This requirement can be implemented in two ways: • identifying  the  portable  storage  device  usage  restrictions,  identifying  portable  storage devices that may be used on external systems, identifying associated external systems on which a portable storage device may be used, and administratively (through the use of a written policy) limiting the usage of the devices to those systems; or • configuring  devices  to  work  only  when  connected  to  a  system  to  which  the  portable storage  device  can  authenticate,  limiting  the  devices’  use  on  external  systems  to  those that the OSA has the ability to manage. Example Your  organization,  which  stores  and  processes  CUI, has  a  written portable device  usage restriction  policy.  It  states  that  users  can  only  use  external  storage  devices  such  as  thumb dives or external hard disks that belong to the company. When needed for a specific business function,  a  user  checks  the  device  out  from  IT  and  returns  it  to  IT  when  no  longer  needed [a,b]. Potential Assessment Considerations • Are the portable storage devices authorized for external use identified and documented [a]? • Are the circumstances defined in which portable storage devices containing CUI may be used on external systems (e.g., with management approval) [b]? • Are  limitations  stipulated  for  the  use  of  portable  storage  devices  containing  CUI  on external systems (e.g., authorized personnel only, encrypted drives required) [b]?

Individuals authorized to post CUI onto publicly accessible systems  are  designated.  The  content  of  information  is  reviewed  prior  to  posting  onto publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic information is not included. FURTHER DISCUSSION Only government officials can be authorized to release CUI to the public. Do not allow CUI to become public - always safeguard the confidentiality of CUI by controlling the posting of CUI on  company-controlled  websites  or  public  forums,  and  the  exposure  of  CUI  in  public presentations  or  on  public  displays.

Such training can include policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to  operations  and  supply  chain  security  within  the  context  of  organizational  information security programs. NIST  SP  800-181  provides  guidance  on  role-based  information  security  training  in  the workplace. SP 800-161 provides guidance on supply chain risk management.

Role-based  training  may  include  awareness  topics  specific  to  individual  roles such  as  ensuring  systems  administrators  understand  the  risk  associated  with  using  an administrative account. Example Your company upgraded the firewall to a newer, more advanced system to protect the CUI it stores. You have been identified as an employee who needs training on the new device [a,b,c].

Insider threat security awareness training focuses on recognizing employee behaviors and characteristics that might be indicators of an insider threat and the guidelines  and  procedures  to  handle  and  report  it.  Training  for  managers  will  provide guidance  on  observing  team  members  to  identify  all  potential  threat  indicators,  while training  for  general  employees  will provide  guidance  for  focusing  on  a  smaller  number  of indicators.  Employee  behaviors  will  vary  depending  on  roles,  team  membership,  and associated   information   needs.   The   person   responsible   for   specifying   insider   threat indicators must be cognizant of these factors. Because of this, organizations may choose to tailor  the  training  for  specific  roles.  This  requirement does  not  require  separate training regarding  insider  threat.  Organizations  may  choose  to  integrate  these  topics  into  their standard security awareness training programs. Example You are responsible for training all employees on the awareness of high-risk behaviors that can indicate  a  potential  insider  threat [b].  You  educate  yourself  on  the  latest  research  on insider threat indicators by reviewing a number of law enforcement bulletins [a]. You then add the following example to the training package: A    baseline of normal behavior for work schedules has been created. One employee’s normal work schedule is 8:00 AM-5:00 PM, but another employee noticed that the employee has been working until 9:00 PM every day even though  no  projects  requiring  additional  hours  have  been  assigned  [b]. The  observing employee reports the abnormal work schedule using the established reporting guidelines. Potential Assessment Considerations • Do  training  materials  include  potential  indicators  associated  with  insider  threats  (e.g., repeated  security  violations,  unusual  work  hours,  unexpected  significant  transfers  of data, suspicious contacts, concerning behaviors outside the workplace) [a,b]? • Do training materials include methods of reporting potential indicators of insider threats to management or responsible security personnel [b]?

Audit  record  reduction  is  an  automated  process  that  interprets  raw  audit  log  data  and extracts meaningful and relevant information without altering the original logs. An example of  log  reduction  for  files  to  be  analyzed  would  be  the  removal  of  details  associated  with nightly backups. Report generation on reduced log information allows you to create succinct customized reports without the need to burden the reader with unimportant information.

Security parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include: registry  settings;  account,  file,  directory  permission  settings;  and  settings  for  functions, ports,   protocols,   and   remote   connections.   Organizations   establish   organization-wide configuration  settings  and  subsequently  derive  specific  configuration  settings  for  systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common   secure   configurations   (also   referred   to   as   security   configuration   checklists, lockdown     and     hardening     guides,     security     reference     guides,     security     technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate      secure      configuration      settings      for      specific information      technology platforms/products  and  instructions  for  configuring  those  system  components  to  meet operational requirements.

Example You  manage  baseline  configurations  for  your  company’s  systems,  including  those  that process, store, and transmit CUI. As part of this, you download a secure configuration guide for each of your asset types (servers, workstations, network components, operating systems, middleware, and applications) from a well-known and trusted IT security organization. You then apply all of the settings that you can while still ensuring the assets can perform the role for which they are needed.

Whitelisting is the stronger of the two policies for restricting software program execution. In  addition  to  whitelisting,  organizations  consider  verifying  the  integrity  of  whitelisted software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions.  Verification  of  whitelisted  software  can  occur  either  prior  to  execution  or  at system startup. NIST SP 800-167 provides guidance on application whitelisting. FURTHER DISCUSSION Organizations  should  determine  their  blacklisting  or  whitelisting  policy  and  configure  the system to manage software that is allowed to run. Blacklisting or deny-by-exception allows all software to run except if on an unauthorized software list such as what is maintained in antivirus solutions. Whitelisting or permit-by-exception does not allow any software to run except if on an authorized software list. The stronger policy of the two is whitelisting. This requirement, CM.L2-3.4.8, requires the implementation of allow-lists and deny-lists for application software. It leverages CM.L2-3.4.1, which requires the organization to establish and maintain software inventories. This  requirement, CM.L2-3.4.8,  also  extends  CM.L2-3.4.9,  which  only  requires  control  and monitoring of any user installed software. Example To  improve  your  company’s  protection  from  malware,  you  have  decided  to  allow  only designated  programs  to  run. With  additional  research  you  identify  a  capability  within  the latest  operating  system  that  can  control  executables,  scripts,  libraries,  or  application installers run in your environment [c]. To ensure success you begin by authorizing digitally signed   executables.   Once they   are   deployed,   you   then   plan   to   evaluate   and   deploy whitelisting for software libraries and scripts [c].

FURTHER DISCUSSION CUI is protected in both physical and digital formats. Physical control can be accomplished using traditional concepts like restricted access to physical locations or locking papers in a desk or filing cabinet. The digitization of data makes access to CUI much easier. CUI can be stored  and  transported  on  magnetic  disks,  tapes,  USB  drives,  CD-ROMs,  and  so  on. This makes digital CUI data very portable. I t is important for an organization to apply mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to CUI due to ease of transport. Example Your team has recently completed configuring a server for  a  DoD  customer. The customer has asked that it be ready to plug in and use. An application installed on the server contains data that is considered CUI. You box the server for shipment using tamper-evident packaging and label it with the specific recipient for the shipment [b]. You select a reputable shipping service so you will get a tracking number to monitor the progress. Once the item is shipped, you send the recipients the tracking number so they can monitor and ensure prompt delivery at their facility. Potential Assessment Considerations • Do only approved individuals have access to media containing CUI [a]? • Is access to the media containing CUI recorded in an audit log [b]? • Is  all  CUI  data  on  media  encrypted  or  physically  locked  prior  to  transport  outside  of secure locations [b]?

Even if the media are lost, proper encryption renders the data inaccessible. When encryption is not an option, apply alternative physical safeguards during transport. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. This requirement, MP.L2-3.8.6, provides additional protections to those provided by MP.L2- 3.8.5.  This  requirement  is  intended  to  protect  against  situations  where  control  of  media access fails, such as through the loss of the media. Example You manage the backups for file servers in your datacenter. You know that in addition to the company’s sensitive information, CUI is stored on the file servers. As part of a broader plan to  protect  data, you  send  the  backup  tapes  off site  to  a  vendor.  You  are  aware  that  your backup software provides the option to encrypt data onto tape. You  develop  a  plan  to  test and enable backup encryption for the data sent off site. This encryption provides additional protections for the data on the backup tapes during transport and offsite storage [a].

Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other types   of   cyber-attacks   that   could   affect   organizational   missions/business   functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration  management  and  control,  trusted  procurement  processes,  and  monitoring technologies to  help  ensure  that  software  does  not  perform  functions  other  than  the functions intended. FURTHER DISCUSSION Removable media are any type of media storage that you can remove from your computer or machine (e.g., CDs, DVDs, diskettes, and USB drives).   Write a specific policy for removable media. The policy should cover the various types of removable media (e.g., write-once media and  rewritable  media)  and  should  discuss  the  company’s approach  to  removable  media. Ensure the following controls are considered and included in the policy: • limit the use of removable media to the smallest number needed; and • scan all removable media for viruses. Example You are in charge of IT operations. You establish a policy for removable media that includes USB drives [a]. The policy information such as: • only USB drives issued by the organization may be used; and • USB drives are to be used for work purposes only [a]. You  set  up  a  separate  computer  to  scan  these  drives  before  anyone  uses  them  on  the network. This computer has anti-virus software installed that is kept up to date.

FURTHER DISCUSSION Provide a plan for monitoring the state of security controls on a recurring basis that occurs more  frequently  than  the  periodic  assessments  discussed  in  CA.L2-3.12.1. This  process provides  a  mechanism  to  assess  the  overall  security  posture  of  your  organization,  which directly  relates  to  activities  discussed  in  CA.L2-3.12.4. As  a  result, the  process  not  only maintains awareness of vulnerabilities and threats, but it also informs management of the effectiveness of the security controls in determining if security controls are current and for management to make an acceptable risk decision. Example You are responsible for ensuring your company fulfills all cybersecurity requirements for its DoD contracts. You review those requirements and the security controls your company has put in place to meet them. You then create a plan to evaluate each control regularly over the next year. You mark several controls to be evaluated by a third-party security assessor. You assign other  IT  resources  in  the  organization to  evaluate  controls  within  their  area  of responsibility. To ensure progress you establish recurring meetings with the accountable IT staff to assess continuous monitoring progress, review security information, evaluate risks from gaps in continuous monitoring, and produce reports for your management [a]. Potential Assessment Considerations • Are the security controls that need to be continuously monitored identified [a]? • Is  the  timeframe  for  continuous  monitoring  activities  to  support  risk-based  decision making defined [a]? • Is the output of continuous monitoring activities provided to stakeholders [a]?

One method of accomplishing this is to create a DMZ network, which enhances security by providing  public  access  to  a  specific  set  of  resources  while  preventing  connections  from those resources to the rest of the IT environment. Some OSAs achieve a similar result through the use of a cloud computing environment that is separated from the rest of the company’s infrastructure.

Split tunneling  presents  a  potential  opportunity  where  an  open  unencrypted  connection from a   public network could allow an adversary to access resources on internal network. As a mitigation strategy, the split tunneling setting should be disabled on all devices so that all traffic, including traffic for external networks or the internet, goes through the VPN. Example You are a system administrator responsible for configuring the network to prevent remote users from using split tunneling. You review the configuration of remote user laptops. You discover  that  remote  users  are  able to  access  files,  email,  database  and  other  services through the VPN connection while also being able to print and access resources on their local network. You change the configuration settings  for  all  company  computers to  disable  split tunneling [a].

In  such  situations,  organizations  determine  what  types  of  confidentiality services are available in commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary safeguards and assurances of the effectiveness of the safeguards     through     appropriate     contracting     vehicles,     organizations     implement compensating   safeguards   or   explicitly   accept   the   additional   risk. An   example   of   an alternative   physical   safeguard   is   a   protected   distribution   system   (PDS)   where   the distribution medium is protected against electronic or physical intercept, thereby ensuring the confidentiality of the information being transmitted. FURTHER DISCUSSION The intent of this requirement is to ensure CUI is cryptographically protected during transit, particularly on the internet. The most common way to accomplish this is to establish a TLS tunnel  between  the  source  and  destination  using  the  most  current  version  of  TLS.  This requirement    does    not    specify    a    mutually    authenticated    handshake,    but    mutual authentication is the most secure approach to creating a tunnel. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. This requirement, SC.L2-3.13.8, requires cryptographic mechanisms be used to prevent the disclosure of CUI in-transit and leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which specifies that the algorithms used must be FIPS-validated cryptography. Example You  are  a  system administrator  responsible  for  configuring  encryption  on  all  devices  that contain  CUI.  Because  your  users  regularly  store  CUI  on  laptops  and  take  them  out  of  the office,  you  encrypt  the  hard  drives  with  a  FIPS-validated  encryption  tool  built  into  the operating system. For users who need to share CUI, you install a Secure FTP server to allow CUI to be transmitted in a compliant manner [a]. You verify that the server is using a FIPS- validated   encryption   module   by   checking   the   NIST   Cryptographic   Module   Validation Program  website  [c]. You  turn  on  the  “FIPS  Compliance”  setting  for  the  server  during configuration  because  that  is  what  is  required  for  this  product  in  order  to  use  only  FIPS- validated cryptography [c].

Usage  restrictions  and implementation guidance apply to the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and  mobile  code  downloaded  and  executed  on  individual  workstations  and  devices  to include all mobile devices and smart phones. The second intent is to monitor the use of mobile code and implement remediation steps if its use does not align with policy. Example Your company has decided to prohibit the use of Flash, ActiveX, and Java plug-ins for web browsers  on  all  of  its  computers  [a].  To  enforce  this  policy  you  configure  the  computer baseline configuration to disable and deny the execution of mobile code [a]. You implement an  exception  process  to  re-enable mobile  code  execution  only  for  those  users  with  a legitimate business need [a]. One department complains that a web application they need to perform their job no longer works. You meet with them and verify that the web application uses ActiveX in the browser. You submit a change request with the Change Review Board. Once the change is approved, you reconfigure the department’s computers to allow the running of ActiveX in the browser. You also configure the company firewall to alert you if ActiveX is used by any website but the allowed one [b]. You set a reminder for yourself to check in with the department at the end of the year to verify they still need that web application. Potential Assessment Considerations • Are there defined limits of mobile code usage and established usage restrictions, which specifically  authorize  use  of  mobile  code  (e.g.,  Java,  JavaScript,  ActiveX,  PDF,  Flash, Shockwave, Postscript, VBScript) within the information system [a]? • Is  the  use  of  mobile  code  documented,  monitored,  and  managed  (e.g., Java,  JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF, Flash, Shockwave, Postscript, VBScript) [b]?

Monitoring should include the users’  activity  for  anything  other  than  what  is  permitted  and  authorized  and  detection  of insecure  or  unauthorized  use  of  the  VoIP  technology.  Security  concerns  for  VoIP  include eavesdropping on calls and using ID spoofing to impersonate trusted individuals. Selecting a solution that can encrypt VoIP traffic is helpful in maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the voice data. Example You are a system administrator responsible for the VoIP system. You configure VoIP for new users after being notified that they have signed the Acceptable Use Policy for VoIP technology [a]. You  verify  that  the  VoIP  solution  is  configured  to  use  encryption  and  have  enabled requirements for passwords on voice mailboxes and on phone extension management. You require  phone  system  administrators  to  log  in  using  multifactor  authentication  when managing  the  system  [a].  You add  the  VoIP  software  to  the  list  of  applications  that  are patched monthly as needed [a,b]. Finally, you configure the VoIP system to send logs to your log aggregator so that they can be correlated with those from other systems and examined for signs of suspicious activity [b].

The methods chosen should depend on the environment and business needs. Implementing  encryption  for  CUI  is  one  approach  to  this  requirement,  but  it  is  not mandatory. Physical security is often employed to restrict access to CUI, particularly when it resides on servers within a company’s offices. Other approaches for protecting CUI include system-related  protections  such  as  configurations  and  rule  sets  for  firewalls,  gateways, intrusion  detection/prevention  systems,  filtering  routers,  and  authenticator  content  that eliminate  attempts  at  exfiltration.  You  may  also  employ  other  security  requirements including secure off-line storage. Because the use of cryptography in this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI, the cryptography used must meet the criteria specified in requirement SC.L2-3.13.11. This  requirement, SC.L2-3.13.16, specifies confidentially  be  provided  for  CUI  at  rest  and complements MP.L2-3.8.9, which specifies confidentially of CUI at backup storage locations. This  requirement, SC.L2-3.13.16,  also  leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which  specifies  that  the algorithms used must be FIPS-validated cryptography. Example 1 Your  company  has  a  policy  stating  CUI  must  be  protected  at  rest  and  you  work  to  enforce that policy. You research Full Disk Encryption (FDE) products that meet the FIPS encryption requirement. After testing, you deploy the encryption to all computers to protect CUI at rest [a]. Example 2 You have used encryption to protect the CUI on most of the computers at your company, but you have some devices that do not support encryption. You create a policy requiring these devices  to  be  signed  out  when  needed,  stay  in  possession  of  the  signer  when  checked  out, and to be signed back in and locked up in a secured closet when the user is done with the device [a]. At the end of the day each Friday, you audit the sign-out sheet and make sure all devices are returned to the closet.

The individuals should assess the risk related to a given alert and act to respond as appropriate. Sometimes  it  may  require  a  configuration  update.  Other  times,  the  information  may  also require adjusting system architecture in order to thwart a threat described in an advisory. Example You  monitor  security advisories  each  week.  You  review  the  alert  emails  and  online subscription  service  alerts  to  determine  which  ones  apply  [b].  You  create  a  list  of  the applicable  alerts  and  research  what  steps  you  need  to  take  to  address  them.  Next,  you generate a plan that you review with your change management group so that the work can be scheduled [c].
